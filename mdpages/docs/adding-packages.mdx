In-project packages are a way of isolating relevant build settings, and importing them to source targets as needed. Some of this may change in future releases as it gets ironed out.

> Note: Basic support for in-project packages has been added as of version 0.7.0. As further features get added, they will be documented here. Package versioning is not supported yet.

## [Overview]

Packages are designed to be independent of the method used to build a target, but importable by source targets. For instance, if there is a target built by CMake, a package can be declared so that the CMake target can be imported by a source target that uses it. Below is the general structure for creating and importing a package:

```json
"package": {
   "glm.static": {
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "includeDirs": "${external:glm}",
         "staticLinks": "${externalBuild:glm}/glm/${ar:glm_static}"
      }
   }
}
"targets": {
   "glm": {
      "kind": "cmakeProject",
      "location": "${external:glm}"
   },
   "my-target": {
      ...
      "importPackages": [
         "glm.static"
      ]
   }
}
```

The package `glm.static` is declared inside of the `package` object with a single include directory, and a static link with the full path to the archive. Because `package` only provides the interfaces for describing a package, it's assumed that the `glm` target it relies will be built somehow before it is imported. When package management is fully-added to Chalet, this will always be the case. Additionally, the target order still matters. If you were to swap the `glm` and `my-target` declarations, the build would fail, because `glm` would be built after `my-target`.

Keep in mind all of the properties defined in your package will be exposed by any target that reads the package. This may be outside of the project's directory structure.

`settings:Cxx` supports a subset of the compile settings described previously. They are as follows:

- `includeDirs`
- `libDirs`
- `links`
- `staticLinks`
- `linkerOptions`
- `appleFrameworkPaths`
- `appleFrameworks`

In the package structure, `searchPaths` and `copyFilesOnRun` can be defined to add additional search paths (for shared libraries compiled outside of the project). They work the same way as their original counterparts.

```json
"package": {
   "glm.static": {
      "searchPaths": [
         "/some/path"
      ],
      "copyFilesOnRun": [
         "/some/file"
      ],
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "includeDirs": "${external:glm}",
         "staticLinks": "${externalBuild:glm}/glm/${ar:glm_static}"
      }
   }
}
```

When a package is imported using `importPackages` in a source target, all of the settings declared in the package get added to the target's build. Like with source targets, the packages can be fine-tuned using property conditions.

> Note: Use variable substitutions with care as they will be the paths relevant to the build file with the package declaration. This will be ironed out in the future.

## [Header-only Packages]

Header-only libraries haven't really been mentioned yet, because they're not a build target (ie. nothing to build), however they fit into the package mold quite nicely. With the above in mind, header-only targets are quite simple - they are a package that only define the `includeDirs`. Then, a compiled source target will import that package and get access to the headers, as shown below:

```json
"package": {
   "fmt": {
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "includeDirs": "${external:fmt}/include",
      }
   }
}
"targets": {
   "my-target": {
      ...
      "importPackages": [
         "fmt"
      ]
   }
}
```

\\

## [Transitive Dependencies]

Packages can also be imported into other packages and transitively added to a build target that depends on it.

```json
"package": {
   "fmt": {
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "includeDirs": "${external:fmt}/include",
      }
   },
   "my-library": {
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "includeDirs": "include",
      },
      "importPackages": [
         "fmt"
      ]
   }
}
```

The above means that when `my-library` is imported into a target, the settings in `fmt` will be imported first.

\\

## [Package Paths]

Packages in other directories can be imported easily by setting addition paths. Let's say you've built a library somewhere outside of your project and want to use that version. In that build file, `package` is declared with the information needed to import it somewhere else, and in your other build file, `packagePaths` can be defined to point to that other location. You can either point to the directory containing the build file, or the exact build file path.

```json
"packagePaths": [
   "/path/to/a/chalet.json",
   "/path/to/a/build/file/"
]
```

During Chalet's package resolution step, the local `package` declaration will be read first, followed by the `packagePaths` directories in the order they're declared. If there is a duplicate package name, the first one that gets resolved will take priority. This means you can override a package by declaring one with the same name locally if you wanted to. If one package has an include for a version of a header-only library, and another package has another version of the same library under the same name, the first one will be imported. 

In the future, versioned packages along with repositories will solve for this issue.
