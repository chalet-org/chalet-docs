By far the most important part of a Chalet project is its targets. Targets are defined in sequential order, and describe individual source compilation targets, CMake projects, other Chalet project, or scripts.

\\

## [Target Types]

The following are the kinds of targets supported:

* Source Target - A folder, set of folders, or files with compilation options. Two types can be made:
   * [Executable Source Target](/schema/latest/chalet-json/target-source-executable) - Describes an executable file to output
   * [Library Source Target](/schema/latest/chalet-json/target-source-library) - Describes a static or shared library to output
* [Chalet Target](/schema/latest/chalet-json/target-chalet) - A subfolder that contains a separate chalet.json
* [CMake Target](/schema/latest/chalet-json/target-cmake) - A subfolder that contains a CMakeLists.txt
* [Script Target](/schema/latest/chalet-json/target-script) - An individual script to run
* [Process Target](/schema/latest/chalet-json/target-process) - A single process with arguments to run

```json
"targets": {
   "first": {
      "kind": "executable",
      "files": "src/first/**.cpp"
   },
   "second": {
      "kind": "cmakeProject",
      "location": "vendor/second"
   },
   "third": {
      "kind": "chaletProject",
      "location": "vendor/third"
   },
   "fourth": {
      "kind": "process",
      "path": "myexec",
      "arguments": [
         "--foo"
      ]
   },
   "post-build": {
      "kind": "script",
      "file": "scripts/post-build.py"
   }
}
```

With this approach, external dependencies can be pulled in from other sources like git, placed wherever we need them, and built as closely as possible to the rest of the project without necessarily having to write extra scripts. Chalet can orchestrate that work for you, in addition to simply building your own source code. 

\\

## [Abstract Targets]

Abstracts are source targets that do not build by themselves, and instead get extended by source targets. For example, if there are two different source targets that both require the same compilation options, one can write them out twice, but that wouldn't be very programmatic. The solution for this is to create an abstract and extend it in each source target. They can be declared in one of two ways.

Firstly, with a root `abstracts` object:

```json
"abstracts": {
   "*": {},
   "minimal": {}
}
```

Secondly, with a colon separating `abstracts` and the name of the abstract target directly in the property key:

```json
// Possibly more desireable in small projects
"abstracts:*": {},
"abstracts:minimal": {}
```

Which one you decide to use doesn't matter, but it's recommended to pick one style over the other rather than mix them. 

An example of how abstracts could be used is if stricter warnings are desired on one target, while they need to be more relaxed on another:

```json
"abstracts": {
   "strict-warnings": {
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "warningsPreset": "strict"
      }
   },
   "min-warnings": {
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "warningsPreset": "minimal"
      }
   }
},
"targets": {
   "first-target": {
      "extends": "strict-warnings"
   },
   "second-target": {
      "extends": "strict-warnings"
   },
   "third-target": {
      "extends": "min-warnings"
   }
}
```

`*` is a special abstract target that gets implicitly extended in all source targets. Therefore, there's no need to define `"extends": "*"` since it would be equivalent to not defining it.

```json
"abstracts:*": {},
"targets": {
   "my-project": {
      // "extends": "*"
   }
}
```

\\

Another way of writing the strict/minimal example, utilizing `*` would be:

```json
"abstracts:*": {
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "warningsPreset": "strict"
   }
},
"targets": {
   "first-target": {},
   "second-target": {},
   "third-target": {
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "warningsPreset": "minimal"
      }
   }
}
```

`"warningsPreset": "minimal"` would simply override `"warningsPreset": "strict"` in this case.

This pattern is useful in situations where one target needs to be compiled as C, while the rest as C++. Another example is that perhaps one target is code you maintain, while another target is code coming from a library written by somebody else.

> Note: A single source target can extend a single abstract target, but an abstract target can not extend another abstract target.

\\

## [Source Targets]

With abstracts out of the way, we can start thinking about how to structure our source targets. As you would expect with any C++ build system, we can add include directories, macro definitions, compiler warnings, define precompiled headers, and a handful of other goodies to ensure our project remains as compiler-independent and cross-platform as possible. 

```json
"targets": {
   "my-project": {
      "kind": "executable",
      "language": "C++",
      "settings:Cxx": {
         ...
      },
      "files": "src/**.cpp"
   }
}
```

When the `kind` property is either `executable` `sharedLibrary` or `staticLibrary`, the target is considered a source target. The main required properties for them are `language`, `settings` and `files`. The `language` property is pretty self-explanatory. Accepted values are `C++` and `C`, and on MacOS, `Objective-C` and `Objective-C++`.

> Note: Objective-C++ implies C++, and Objective-C implies C, so files of both types can be combined in the same source target.



\\

## [Target Descriptions]

All target types can take a `outputDescription` property that explicitly change the header to something else. For example, if the list of targets look something like:

```json
"targets": {
   "my-target": {}
}
```

The default output would be:

```
▼  Build: my-target
```

If the outputDescription is changed:

```json
"targets": {
   "my-target": {
      "outputDescription": "My super cool project!"
   }
}
```

The output would become:

```
▼  My super cool project!
```

> Note: Unicode is supported (given the capabilities of the terminal). As long as the chalet.json itself is Unicode, the outputDescription should display correctly.

\\

## [Property Conditions]

Most properties support conditions that describe whether to include or exclude them from the build. The syntax for conditions is relatively simple. At the end of a property, add square brackets  `[` `]`, and inside them, one can express a number of things that limit when the property's value is read. Take the following example:

```json
"links[configuration:debugSymbols]": [ "foo-d" ]
```

When the build configuration has debug symbols, (aka in Debug,RelWithDebInfo,Profile), link against `foo-d`. Chalet always expects pairs of `key:value`. In the above, `configuration` is the kay, and `debugSymbols` is the value. To use the same key with multiple values, the syntax is: `key:{value1,value2}`, and would match `value1` **OR** `value2`. Any number of values is supported.

Since debug/release is a common thing to express, the short-hand version of the above example is this:

```json
"links[:debug]": [
   "foo-d"
]
```

The key in this case is blank, because The value of `debug` has only one meaning. Platforms can also be expressed this way, with either `platform:value` or `:value`. Platform values are currently `windows`, `macos` and `linux`.

```json
"links[platform:windows]": [
   "foo"
],
"links[:windows]": [
   "foo"
],
```

The following would express `linux` **OR** `macos`:

```json
"links[platform:{linux,macos}]": [
   "bar"
],
"links[:{linux,macos}]": [
   "bar"
],
```

To express **NOT**, simply place an exclamation mark in front of the value, but after the colon:

```json
"links[:!debug]": [ // NOT debug
   "foo"
],
"links[:debug]": [ // debug
   "foo-d"
],
```

The toolchain can also be expressed in conditions and must use the `toolchain` key. The value can technically be anything as long as it matches against a toolchain name or target triple. The latter should be preferred, as the toolchain name isn't guaranteed. There's nothing stopping someone from editing their toolchain name, but the triple will always be defined by the compiler (and Chalet in some edge cases).

```json
"defines[toolchain:x86_64-apple-darwin]": [
   "MY_PROJ_MAC_X86_64"
],
"defines[toolchain:x64-pc-windows-msvc]": [
   "MY_PROJ_MSVC_X64"
],
"defines[toolchain:w64-mingw32]": [ // matches against w64-mingw32 of any architecture
   "MY_PROJ_MINGW"
]
```

Environment variables can also be expressed, but currently only whether one is defined or not. For example:

```json
"defines[env:CI]": [ // matches if defined
   "MY_PROJ_CI_BUILD"
],
"defines[env:!CI]": [ // matches if not defined
   "MY_PROJ_NO_CI_BUILD"
]
```

This would define a variable if `CI` is defined or not defined by the system. the value of the environment variable itself is not checked.

To express multiple conditions, they can be combined with `+` for **AND**, or `|` for **OR**. If there are more than 2 conditions, operators are mutually exclusive, so only one or the other can be used. 

Also of note is that values are still always **OR**, so consider that in the below example. 

```json
"links[platform:{linux,macos}+configuration:debugSymbols]": [
   "bar"
]
"links[platform:{linux,macos}+:debug]": [
   "bar"
]
```

The above `links` property would be used if the platform is `linux` **OR** `macos` **AND** the configuration has debug symbols. If the `+` were a `|`, it would evaluate to `linux` **OR** `macos` **OR** if the configuration has debug symbols. This may come up in the context of cross-compilation and script targets -- MinGW compiles programs for Windows, but can be compiled from Windows or Linux, so it might be desireable to make a condition for the toolchain itself **OR** the Windows platform.

Next, consider the following example:

```json
"links[:{!linux,!macos}]": [ // bad!
   "bar"
]
"links[platform:{!linux,!macos}]": [ // bad!
   "bar"
]
```

This is technically allowed, but would express **NOT** `linux` **OR NOT** `macos`, which wouldn't make sense -- it would end up evaluating to both on both platforms. Curly braces always represent **OR** between multiple values. The correct way to do this would be to separate them with `+`, so that it reads **NOT** `linux` **AND NOT** `macos`.

```json
"links[:!linux+:!macos]": [ // good!
   "bar"
],
"links[platform:!linux+platform:!macos]": [ // good!
   "bar"
]
```

**Ordering**

If a single property is defined with multiple conditions, each one will be read in the order they're declared.

```json
"settings:Cxx": {
   "links": [
      "foo"
   ],
   "links[:debug]": [
      "bar"
   ],
   "links[:windows]": [
      "another"
   ]
}
```

In the above example, if one is building the Debug configuration on windows, The `foo` link is added first, followed by `bar` and then `another`. If Release: `foo` is still added first followed by `another`.

The following table is the full list of accepted values:

| Key | Values | Short-hand |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| platform | `:windows` | `:windows` |
|  | `:macos` | `:macos` |
|  | `:linux` | `:linux` |
| condition | `:debugSymbols` | `:debug` |
|  | `:enableProfiling` | No |
|  | `:interproceduralOptimization` | No |
| toolchain | toolchain name, target triple, or partial of either | No |
| architecture | The cpu architecture to match (ex. `x86_64` `i686` `arm64`) | No |
| options | `:runTarget` (build targets only) | `:runTarget` |
| env | Environment variable by name, checks if defined | No |


\\

## [Excluding Targets]

Targets can be excluded with the `condition` property, and work the exact same way as property conditions, but must start and end with square brackets.

```json
"first-target": {
   "condition": "[:debug+:!windows]"
}
"second-target": {
   "condition": "[:linux]"
}
```

\\

## [Adding Source Files]

Source files can either be added individually or via a glob pattern. In both scenarios, source files will be based on their extensions:

| C++              | Any extension other than the ones below, but most common are: `cpp` `cc` `cxx` `c++` `C` |
| C                | `c` (case-sensitive) |
| Windows Resource | `rc` / `RC` |
| Objective-C      | `m` / `M` |
| Objective-C++    | `mm` |

C++ header files should not be specified at all, so for instance if you're using `.cpp` and `.h` files, only add 

> Note: Lowercase extensions are recommended

\

To start defining files, simply add a property called `files`. They can be added individually via an array:

```json
"files": [
   "src/main.cpp",
   "src/foo.cpp",
   "src/bar.cpp"
]
```

Or matched via a glob pattern:

```json
"files": [
   "src/**.cpp",
   "tests/*.cpp"
]
```

`*` in this case matches files in a single path, while `**` matches files recursively though any subdirectories. Therefor, these can be combined with the following pattern if you wish to exclude files in a directory, but include any of its subdirectories:

```json
"files": [
   "src/*/**.cpp"
]
```

Using glob patterns, files can also be expressed as a single string:

```json
"files": "src/**.{cpp,rc}"
```


Property conditions are also supported:

```json
"files": [
   "src/Foo/**.cpp"
]
"files[:windows]": [
   "src/Windows/**.cpp"
]
"files[:macos]": [
   "src/MacOS/**.cpp"
]
```

The above example would detect any `.cpp` and `.rc` files within the `src` folder. Extensions must be separated by a comma or a `|` character and surrounded by a set of curly braces.

Files can also be expressed as an object with `include` and `exclude`. Excludes can be expressed as an exact file match, a glob pattern, or a regular string to match against.

```json
"files": {
   "include": "src/**.cpp",
   "exclude[:!macos]": [
      "src/MacOS"
   ],
   "exclude[:!linux]": [
      "Linux"
   ]
}
```

> Note: Because files can be declared differently, no assumptions are made about [include directories](/docs/creating-targets?id=include-directories), so if `src/**.cpp` is the pattern used, `src` should be included 

\\

## [Project Metadata]

Project metadata is the same as [Workspace metadata](/docs/the-build-file?id=workspace-metadata), but the key difference is in how it is referenced later in [Configure Files](/docs/creating-targets?id=configure-files) and [Variable substitutions](/docs/creating-targets?id=variable-substitution). In projects, simply add the `metadata` property, and the inner properties are the same as they are at the workspace level. The following are supported:

| name | The individual project's name. |
| version | A version string that can take up to four components (if different from the workspace). |
| author | The author or maintainer of the project (if different from the workspace). |
| description | A description of the project. |
| license | The name of file that describes the project's license (if different from the workspace). |
| readme | The name of the readme file (if different from the workspace). |
| homepage | The homepage website of the project (if different from the workspace). |

Example:

```json
"my-target": {
   "kind": "executable",
   "metadata": {
      "name": "Example Name",
      "version": "4.0.1",
      "author": "Jane Doe",
      "description": "A brand new project",
      "license": "LICENSE.txt",
      "readme": "README.md",
      "homepage": "www.foo.town"
   },
   ...
}
```

\\

## [Configure Files]

Configure files allow one to take the contents of a file, replace variables with metadata, build paths or other information, and and output the file during the build in order to get that information into your program. The most common use-case for this is versioning, where a C++ header is the output.

To use configure files, simply set `configureFiles` to a string or an array of strings to paths of files that must be processed. The files must end in `.in`, but can be anything. They are guaranteed to be processed after Chalet initialized and before the build starts.

```json
"first-project": {
   "files": "foo/**.{cpp,rc}",
   "configureFiles": "foo/config.h.in"
}
"second-project": {
   "files": "bar/**.{cpp,rc}",
   "configureFiles": [
      "bar/config1.h.in",
      "bar/config2.h.in"
   ]
}
```

All [variable substitutions](/docs/creating-targets?id=variable-substitution) are supported, as well as the variables below in either `${VAR}` or `%VAR%` style. To provide some compatibility with CMake projects, the variables `CMAKE_PROJECT_*` work as well, and return the same values as `WORKSPACE_*`.

| `PROJECT_NAME` | `WORKSPACE_NAME` |
| `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION` | `WORKSPACE_DESCRIPTION` |
| `PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL` | `WORKSPACE_HOMEPAGE_URL` |
| `PROJECT_AUTHOR` | `WORKSPACE_AUTHOR` |
| `PROJECT_LICENSE` | `WORKSPACE_LICENSE` |
| `PROJECT_README` | `WORKSPACE_README` |
| `PROJECT_VERSION` | `WORKSPACE_VERSION` |
| `PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR` | `WORKSPACE_VERSION_MAJOR` |
| `PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR` | `WORKSPACE_VERSION_MINOR` |
| `PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH` | `WORKSPACE_VERSION_PATCH` |
| `PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK` | `WORKSPACE_VERSION_TWEAK` |

**See also:**

[Variable Substitution](/docs/creating-targets?id=variable-substitution)

\\

## [Compile Settings]

Like with abstracts, compile settings can be expressed in two ways:

```json
"my-project": {
   "settings:Cxx": {}
}
```

or:

```json
"my-project": {
   "settings": {
      "Cxx": {}
   }
}
```

> Note: At the moment, `Cxx` is the only sub-type, but as Chalet matures, more may be added.

\\

## [Chalet Targets]

Chalet targets are like saying "I have a Chalet project in a separate repository and want it to build during this project's build."  This is a feature that may not get a lot of use in these early days, but could serve as a foundation for package management in the future. One would want to combine this feature with `externalDependencies`, which would pull down a git repository prior to building.

To build another Chalet project, set `kind` to `chaletProject`, and define the `location` as the directory where the `chalet.json` of the project exists. If using a custom build file name, you can specify it with `buildFile`. This is a path relative to the location, so by default its value is `chalet.json`.

The only other property is `recheck` which if true, will check the project for changes each time a build is run. If not defined, this will default to `true`. Setting this to false by nature would speed up rebuilds because chalet wouldn't need to be invoked after the target has already been built once.

```json
"my-chalet-target": {
   "kind": "chaletProject",
   "condition": "[:!windows]",
   "location": "${externalDir}/bar",
   "recheck": false
}
```

One can also control whether the target is rebuilt or cleaned with the `rebuild` and `clean` boolean properties respectively.

\\

## [CMake Targets]

CMake projects can be built as a build step / target of a Chalet project. This is the ideal choice for working with a library needs to be built with CMake before a source target that relies on that library, or if a build is better accomplished with CMake, but one wants to use Chalet to manage the command given to CMake. Chalet will pick an appropriate CMake generator based on its own toolchain, generate the build files with the given defines and toolset specification (if applicable), then build during the same step (using the `cmake --build` method). 

At the moment, these are the generators used:

| Ninja  | If the toolchain's `strategy` is ninja, this will always be the generator |
| Visual Studio ## #### | If using MSVC and not using Ninja, this generator will be based on the version of MSVC detected (up to Visual Studio 17 2022). |
| MinGW Makefiles  | If on Windows, and the toolchain does not use Ninja or MSVC |
| Unix Makefiles  | If not Windows, and the toolchain does not use Ninja |

To build another CMake project, set `kind` to `cmakeProject`, and define the `location` as the directory where the `CMakeLists.txt` of the project exists. If using a custom build file name, you can specify it with `buildFile`. This is passed directly to the `-C` CMake option.

The only other property is `recheck` which if true, will check the project for changes each time a build is run. If not defined, this will default to `true`. Setting this to false by nature would speed up rebuilds because CMake wouldn't need to be invoked after the target has already been built once.

```json
"my-cmake-target": {
   "kind": "cmakeProject",
   "condition": "[:!windows]",
   "location": "${externalDir}/foo",
   "recheck": false
}
```

One can also control whether the target is rebuilt or cleaned with the `rebuild` and `clean` boolean properties respectively.

To build a specific CMake target or targets (`-t` build option), simply define them under `targets`. 

If using a toolset specification (`-T` option), simply define it under `toolset`.

Chalet will attempt to add appropriate cache entries with `-D` based on its own settings and toolchain, but if one wants to override these, this can be done by adding `defines` manually, without the `-D` option.

```json
"my-cmake-target": {
   "kind": "cmakeProject",
   "location": "${externalDir}/foo",
   "defines": [
      "CMAKE_C_COMPILER=foo",
      "CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=foo++"
   ],
   "targets": [
      "foobar"
   ]
}
```

\\

## [Script Targets]

Script targets are quite simple. They are triggered by setting the `kind` property to `script`. In addition to the `condition` and `description` properties, they only take a `script` property (that can also be suffixed with a property condition.

The following file extensions are supported:

| `.sh`  | Bash / Unix shell |
| `.bat` | Windows Batch |
| `.ps1` | Powershell ([Powershell Core](//github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) is also supported on non-windows) |
| `.py`  | Python |
| `.rb`  | Ruby |
| `.pl`  | Perl |
| `.lua` | Lua |

Portable shebangs — `#!/usr/bin/env (executable)` — are supported with any extension.

The following examples are all valid:

```json
"my-first-script": {
   "kind": "script",
   "description": "The very first script",
   "file[:!windows]": "scripts/script.sh",
   "file[:windows]": "scripts/script.bat",
   "arguments": [
      "foo",
      "bar"
   ]
}
"my-second-script": {
   "kind": "script",
   "condition": "[:windows]",
   "file[:debug]": "scripts/script_Debug.bat",
   "file[:!debug]": "scripts/script_Release.bat"
}
"my-second-script": {
   "kind": "script",
   "condition": "[:windows]",
   "file": "scripts/script.ps1"
}
"my-third-script": {
   "kind": "script",
   "file": "scripts/script.py",
   "arguments": [
      "${buildDir}",
      "${targetTriple}",
      "${meta:workspaceName}"
   ]
}
```

The `arguments` property can take any arguments that are required by the script, and support [variable substitutions](/docs/creating-targets?id=variable-substitution) to pass along information about the build.

\\

## [Process Targets]

Process targets are a means to call another executable directly using Chalet's subprocess features. Simply set `kind` to `process` to create one.

```json
"my-process": {
   "kind": "process",
   "path": "msbuild",
   "arguments": [
      "-nologo",
      "-property:Configuration=${configuration}",
      "project.csproj"
   ]
}
```

The `path` property can either be the full path to an executable (not recommended), or a searchable executable name that can be found from a terminal (in PATH). The `arguments` property can take any arguments that are required by the process, and support [variable substitutions](/docs/creating-targets?id=variable-substitution) to pass along information about the build.

\\

## [Run Targets]

A target is considered runnable if the kind is `executable`, `script` or `cmakeProject`. If it's runnable, it can be used during `chalet buildrun` and `chalet run` commands. If the kind is `cmakeProject`, it will require the `runExecutable` property.

```json
"first-target": {
   "kind": "executable",
   "files": "src/**.cpp",
   "defaultRunArguments": [
      "--foo",
      "-i",
      "bar"
   ],
   "copyFilesOnRun[:windows]": [
      "${env:SOME_PATH}/stubborn_lib.dll"
   ]
},
"second-target": {
   "kind": "script",
   "file": "scripts/do_something.sh"
}
```

An executable target can also take the `defaultRunArguments` and `copyFilesOnRun` properties. The `defaultRunArguments` property is simply an array of the default arguments to run. These values will be cached in settings, where it can be changed on-demand. `copyFilesOnRun` is meant for shared libraries that have to be copied to the build folder at the time of execution. In most cases, it's not needed as long as the shared library is accessible from PATH, but if for example, WinApi's LoadLibrary is called, it might be necessary to have the file in the same path as the executable.

\\

## [Variable Substitution]

In some areas, variable substitution is supported for environment variables, metadata, and relative paths that could vary between machines.

In build target contexts, the following is supported:

| `${architecture}` | The current build architecture |
| `${targetTriple}` | The current build architecture target triple |
| `${buildDir}` | The main build directory for the current configuration & architecture |
| `${cwd}` | The current working directory (this shouldn't be needed, but it's here just in case) |
| `${configuration}` | The current build configuration |
| `${externalDir}` | The root path for external dependencies. See [externalDependencies](/schema/latest/chalet-json?id=external-dependencies) |
| `${externalBuildDir}` | The build path for an external dependency. For instance, if a CMake project is located at `${externalDir}/foo`, it will build to `${buildDir}/${externalDir}/foo`, so it's easier to write `${externalBuildDir}/foo` |
| `${home}`, `~/` | The home directory of the machine. On Windows, this is `C:\Users\(Name)` |
| `${name}` | The name of the build/distribution target |
| `${env:(Name)}` | An environment variable by name. For example: `${env:MY_LIBRARY_PATH}` |
| `${meta:(Name)}` | Metadata with context of an individual source target's `metadata` properties. `meta:workspaceXXX` always returns workspace metadata, while `meta:XXXX` could return workspace or source target metadata. |

In distribution target contexts, the above is supported, in addition to:

| `${distributionDir}` | The main output directory for the distribution |

The metadata variables are as follows:

| `${meta:name}` | `${meta:workspaceName}` |
| `${meta:description}` | `${meta:workspaceDescription}` |
| `${meta:homepage}` | `${meta:workspaceHomepage}` |
| `${meta:author}` | `${meta:workspaceAuthor}` |
| `${meta:license}` | `${meta:workspaceLicense}` |
| `${meta:readme}` | `${meta:workspaceReadme}` |
| `${meta:version}` | `${meta:workspaceVersion}` |
| `${meta:versionMajor}` | `${meta:workspaceVersionMajor}` |
| `${meta:versionMinor}` | `${meta:workspaceVersionMinor}` |
| `${meta:versionPatch}` | `${meta:workspaceVersionPatch}` |
| `${meta:versionTweak}` | `${meta:workspaceVersionTweak}` |
