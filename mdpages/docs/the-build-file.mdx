---

The philosophy behind Chalet projects is quite simple: Abstract away only what needs to be abstracted, and unify as much of the build as possible. The build file, `chalet.json` is the vehicle for this. 

From a high level, it's structured as follows:

```json
{
   ... (metadata)
   "seachPaths": [ ... ],
   "variables": [ ... ],
   "allowedArchitectures": [ ... ],
   "defaultConfigurations": [ ... ],
   "configurations": { ... },
   "externalDependencies": { ... },
   "abstracts": { ... },
   "targets": { ... },
   "distribution": { ... },
}
```

| metadata | Metadata related to the entire workspace. |
| seachPaths | Additional relative paths to search for compiled dependencies not otherwise found. |
| variables | Local variables to shorten build paths without modifying the build environment. |
| allowedArchitectures | An array of allowed target architecture triples supported by the project. |
| defaultConfigurations | An array of default build configurations supported by the project. |
| configurations | Custom build configurations |
| externalDependencies | External dependencies to resolve before building. (ie. from git, or a local path) |
| targets | Build targets. |
| abstracts | Abstract build targets that build targets can inherit from. |
| distribution | Distribution targets. |

## [Workspace Metadata]

Workspace metadata is simply a set of strings used to describe the project. These can be referenced in various places later on. The following properties are supported:

| name | The workspace name. |
| version | A version string that can take up to four components. |
| author | The author or maintainer of the workspace. |
| description | A description of the workspace. |
| license | The name of file that describes the license. |
| readme | The name of the readme file. |
| homepage | The homepage website of the project. |

Example:

```json
{
   "name": "Example Name",
   "version": "4.0.1",
   "author": "Jane Doe",
   "description": "A brand new project",
   "license": "LICENSE.txt",
   "readme": "README.md",
   "homepage": "www.foo.town",
   ...
}
```

## [External Dependencies]

Before diving into build target details, one should consider how to import libraries and external code. In general, it's best to separate that code from your project's code. if using git, one can use submodules for this, scripts, or an external package manager in combination with adding appropriate paths to `.gitignore`.

Chalet has a method of streamlining dependencies from a variety of sources. It makes no assumptions about the paths themselves, so it's up to the developer to figure out what to do with it afterwards. The advantage of this is that these dependencies can be excluded from your project's repository, without requiring git submodules or another script to pull them down. This will serve as a basis for package management in the future.

External dependencies require the `externalDependencies` property at the root of your build file. Other kinds of dependencies are named properties inside of that.

```json
"externalDependencies": {
   ...
}
```

`chalet configure` is the main mechanism used to pull or refresh external dependencies, however `chalet build` will also pull in dependencies if `configure` hasn't been run.

**The External Directory**

Chalet uses a folder called `chalet_external` to store dependencies (just git for now). This path can be changed via the `--external-dir` or `-e` command line option. Some might want to use `external` or `vendor` for instance, however, the default `chalet_external` was chosen to differentiate between dependencies managed by Chalet, and otherwise.

The directory of a dependency can be referenced in the build file with the `${external:(Name)}` variable substitution variable explained at [Variable Substitution](/docs/creating-targets?id=variable-substitution).

The subfolder of the dependency will always be the object node's name. For example, the following:

```json
"externalDependencies": {
   "bar-repo": {
      ...
   }
}
```

... will use `${external:bar-repo}` (or `chalet_external/bar-repo` by default).

**Conditions**

Discussed in more detail on the next page, certain external dependencies can be excluded based on conditions, for instance if one is only needed on a particular platform.

```json
"externalDependencies": {
   "bar-repo": {
      "condition": "[:windows]"
      ...
   }
}
```

## [Git Dependencies]

Git dependencies are the most straightforward way of bringing code into your project. The repository is shallow-cloned and placed inside of a `chalet_external` folder local to the workspace.

With it, one can add a series of repos, define what branch, tag or commit to clone the repo from, and then Chalet can lightly manage it from there - for instance, if a branch changed since the last time `chalet configure` was ran, the dependency's local path will be refreshed. For this reason, the more specific - the better.

To define a git dependency, set `"kind": "git"` along with the `repository` property. It should take any valid git repository path.

```json
"externalDependencies": {
   "foo-repo": {
      "kind": "git",
      "repository": "https://github.com/foo/foo.git"
   },
   "foo2-repo": {
      "kind": "git",
      "repository": "git@github.com:foo/foo2.git",
      "branch": "develop"
   },
   "bar-repo": {
      "kind": "git",
      "repository": "https://my-website.io/bar/bar.git",
      "commit": "2b74ae96d9649d26be9a3deea0862ac1ad29c19b"
   }
}
```

Chalet also supports repositories with submodules, via the `submodules` property.

```json
"foo-repo": {
   "kind": "git",
   "repository": "https://github.com/foo/foo.git",
   "submodules": true
}
```

To define a commit id, use the `commit` property, which must contain between 7 and 40 characters, pointing to a correct commit hash.

```json
"bar-repo": {
   "kind": "git",
   "repository": "https://my-website.io/bar/bar.git",
   "commit": "2b74ae9"
}
```

To define a tag, use the `tag` property with a valid tag:

```json
"bar-repo": {
   "kind": "git",
   "repository": "https://my-website.io/bar/bar.git",
   "tag": "v4.2"
}
```

To define a branch, use the `branch` property with a valid branch name:

```json
"bar-repo": {
   "kind": "git",
   "repository": "https://my-website.io/bar/bar.git",
   "branch": "experimental"
}
```

The `branch` & `commit` properties can also be combined:

```json
"bar-repo": {
   "kind": "git",
   "repository": "https://my-website.io/bar/bar.git",
   "branch": "experimental",
   "commit": "2b74ae9"
}
```

If a repository only references the branch or doesn't use a branch, commit, or tag, then the repository will be updatable whenever newer commits are pushed to it. However, this update process is only done when one re-runs `chalet configure` since checking & updating the repos from the build commands can take extra time, and may unexpectedly break a build if a repository is unstable. If a branch, tag, or commit is changed in `externalDependencies`, the repository will be re-fetched before the next build.

\\

## [Local Dependencies]

Sometimes, you just want to do something yourself. That's where local dependencies come in. It simply tells Chalet to refer to a local path on the machine for a given dependency, and validates whether the path exists. Simple use `"kind": "local"` to declare a local dependency.

```json
"bar-repo": {
   "kind": "local",
   "path": "D:/Development/bar-repo"
}
```

This is obviously not very portable, since `path` is a Windows path. The recommended approach in this case is to reference an environment variable:

```json
"bar-repo": {
   "kind": "local",
   "path": "${env:BAR_REPO_PATH}"
}
```

However, you can also use a [Property Condition](/docs/creating-targets?id=property-conditions) inside of `path` to refer to paths that differ between platforms.

With local paths, `${external:bar-repo}` will simply resolve to the given path for that platform.

\\

## [Script Dependencies]

Scripts are discussed in detail on the next page [here](/docs/creating-targets?id=script-targets), so they are typically run during builds, but in the case of dependencies, you can run a script only during the `configure` step, to for instance, run a script that was pulled down by a previous git dependency. It's not an ideal scenario, but it can be done.

```json
"externalDependencies": {
   "bar-repo": {
      "kind": "git",
      "repository": "https://my-website.io/bar/bar.git",
      "tag": "v4.2"
   },
   "bar-repo-script": {
      "kind": "script",
      "file": "${external:bar-repo}/scripts/do-more.sh",
      "arguments": [
         "--foo"
      ]
   }
}
```

[Script Targets](/docs/creating-targets?id=script-targets) 

\\

## [System Dependencies]

Sometimes it may be desireable to use package manager dependencies if they're available, so Chalet has a means of restricting the build to only run if those dependencies are found. The following are supported: 

| ubuntu.system |
| debian.system |
| archlinux.system |
| manjaro.system |
| fedora.system |
| redhat.system |
| windows.msys2 |
| macos.homebrew |
| macos.macports |


```json
"platformRequires": {
   "ubuntu.system": "foo",
   "archlinux.system": "foo-develop",
   "windows.msys2[architecture:x86_64]": "foo",
   "macos.homebrew[architecture:x86_64]": "bar",
   "macos.macports": [
      "devfoo",
      "baz"
   ]
}
```

> Note: This feature is still experimental, and will likely change in the future.

[Property Conditions](/docs/creating-targets?id=property-conditions)

\\

## [Allowed Architectures]

In order to communicate which target architectures are supported by the build, one can add the `allowedArchitectures` array in the root of the build file. If this list is not empty (default), the target triple will be matched against this list at the start of the build. If it's not in the list, the build will be stopped.

```json
"allowedArchitectures": [
   "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc",
   "arm64-apple-darwin",
   "x86_64-apple-darwin",
   "universal-apple-darwin",
   "x86_64-w64-mingw32"
]
```
