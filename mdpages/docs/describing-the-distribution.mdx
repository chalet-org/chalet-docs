---

Another thing that Chalet can help out with is to organize one's project for distribution. This implies different things on each operating system, but ultimately means copying built binaries, dependent shared libraries, and other files into some kind of folder structure or archive meant for distribution.

\\

## [Distribution Types]

Like with targets, the `distribution` property takes named objects describing bundles, or individual parts of the final distribution.
They also take a `kind` property that tells Chalet how to proceed with each distribution. The current types are as follows:

* [Bundle](/schema/latest/chalet-json/dist-bundle) - A group of files/folders, optionally defined by a subdirectory. On MacOS, this can be an app bundle
* [Archive](/schema/latest/chalet-json/dist-archive) - Describes files/folders to include in a .zip archive
* [Script](/schema/latest/chalet-json/dist-script) - A path to an individual script to run
* [MacOS Disk Image](/schema/latest/chalet-json/dist-macos-disk-image) - Describes a MacOS DMG disk image to create

The command-line command to create the distribution is:

```bash
chalet bundle
```

However, it is recommended to explicitly give the bundle command the build configuration:

```bash
chalet -c Release bundle
```

Like with `build`, this will sequentially go through each distribution target and perform a given task that they describe. If a distribution target requires a certain build, these will be determined prior, and those builds will be run. Also like with build targets, distributions can be described via the `outputDescription` property:

```json
"MyApp": {
   "outputDescription": "Bundling my application..."
}
```

This would produce the header output:

```
â–¼  Bundling my application...
```

\

**Excluding Distribution Targets**

Distribution targets can be excluded with the `condition` property, but only take the platform.

```json
"some-target": {
   "condition": "[:windows]"
}
```

\\

## [Bundles]

A bundle distribution target describes a group of files and folders, and if you're familiar with MacOS, optionally an application bundle. Consider the following example:

```json
"distribution": {
   "MyApp": {
      "kind": "bundle",
      "buildTargets": [
          "shared-lib",
          "my-executable"
      ]
   }
}
```

In settings, Chalet has a "distributionDir" property (`-d` or `--distribution-dir` from the command line), that defines the root path for distribution targets, that defaults to `dist`. 

`buildTargets` are an array of build target names to include in the distribution target. In the above example, the output files of `shared-lib` `my-executable` are copied to `dist`. 

> Note: the above is also true on MacOS - Application bundles are expressed differently, explained further down.

\\

## [The Main Executable]

If a distribution target has a single executable defined in `buildTargets`, it will be considered the "main" executable used in platform-specific files like Info.plist on MacOS. If more than one executable is defined in the same distribution target, the first executable will be picked. However, to avoid this ambiguity, one can define the main executable target with the `mainExecutable` property.

```json
"MyApp": {
   "mainExecutable": "my-executable",
   "buildTargets": [
      "my-other-executable",
      "my-executable"
   ]
}
```

\\

## [Subdirectories]

One can specify a subdirectory to contain the distribution inside of with the `subdirectory` property. For example, if the project produces a library, it can be delegated into a 'lib' folder:

```json
"distribution": {
   "bin-dir": {
      "subdirectory": "bin",
      "buildTargets": [
         "shared-lib",
         "my-executable"
      ]
   },
   "lib-dir": {
      "subdirectory": "lib",
       "buildTargets": [
          "static-lib"
      ],
      "include": [
         "${ar:shared-lib}"
      ]
   }
}
```

This would place the binaries for shared-lib and my-executable in `(distDir)/bin` and the output of static-lib in `(distDir)/lib`.

\\

## [Dependant Shared Libraries]

By default, executables and shared libraries will be read for dependant shared libraries. If any are found in Path at the time of bundling, they will also be included (except for system libraries). This behavior can be controlled with the `includeDependentSharedLibraries` property. 

```json
"MyApp": {
   "includeDependentSharedLibraries": false
}
```

\\

## [Includes and Excludes]

To include (or exclude) other files and folders, simply define the `include` or `exclude` arrays. These can also be defined with platform conditions. It is recommended to only define paths and files that are within the project directory. The paths in either array can also take glob patterns. These files and folders will be copied directly into the distribution folder or into `(distDir)/(subdirectory)` if `subdirectory` is defined. If a folder is included, its subdirectories will be preserved.

In MacOS application bundles, these includes will be placed in the `Resources` directory of the bundle structure.

```json
"MyApp": {
   "include": [
      "content"
   ],
   "exclude": [
      "*.psd",
      "Thumbs.db",
      ".DS_Store"
   ]
}
```

\\

## [Windows Settings]

At the moment, Windows bundles will just copy the required files into an output folder. The only setting at the moment controls whether the Windows runtime dlls get copied - these are specifically the `api-ms-win-*.dll` files. See [Universal CRT Deployment](//learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/universal-crt-deployment?view=msvc-170) for details. To define whether or not these get copied (for debugging, generally), add the `windows` object followed by the `includeRuntimeDlls` boolean property.

```json
"MyApp": {
   "kind": "bundle",
   "windows": {
      "includeRuntimeDlls": false
   }
}
```

\\

## [Linux Desktop Entries]

For Linux, Chalet can create a `.desktop` file for desktop environments that support the XDG Desktop Entry specification. These are basically your app shortcuts on those desktop environments. At the moment, they just point to the distribution directly, so it's obviously not portable. Anything further like moving the distribution elsewhere would require a script. To define a desktop entry, the `linuxDesktopEntry` object must be present, along with the `template` property.

```json
"MyApp": {
   "kind": "bundle",
   "linuxDesktopEntry": {
      "template": "platform/linux/app.desktop",
      "icon": "platform/linux/app-logo.png"
   }
}
```

The `icon` property points to a `.png` or `.svg` image of your choosing. For size: 256x256 is a safe bet. This icon gets copied to the distribution target's directory.

`template` points to the location of an input .desktop file. If one doesn't exist, it will be created. Since it's considered a template, the contents of this file have a few special variables that get replaced during the bundle step. If the contents are as follows:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Categories=Application;
Terminal=false
Exec=${mainExecutable}
Path=${path}
Name=${name}
Comment=
Icon=${icon}
```

| `${name}`           | The bundle's name, so in the examples above, this would be "MyApp" |
| `${path}`           | The full path to the application bundle's directory (or subdirectory) |
| `${mainExecutable}` | The main executable, explained [here](/docs/describing-the-distribution?id=the-main-executable) |
| `${icon}`           | The path to the icon. This ends up being the copy placed in the distribution target's folder |

\\

## [MacOS Bundles]

In the MacOS world, bundles have an entirely different meaning, where applications are bundled into specific folder structures that the OS interprets in various ways. Out of these, Chalet currently just supports Application bundles (`.app`), but will hopefully support others in the future.

By defining the `macosBundle` property with a `type`, the distribution target will be treated as that bundle type, managing includes & excludes differently.

Application bundles are created with `"type": "app"`. Included files will be treated as Resources, with the exception of `.dylib` files, which will get copied into the bundle's `Frameworks` directory. Dependant frameworks themselves will be detected by the build targets that use them, and copied into the Frameworks directory separately, so that they don't have to be included manually.

The `icon` property defines an icon for the app. If a `.png` is defined, it will be converted to an `.icns` behind the scenes before being bundled. It can also be defined as an `.icns` to begin with and will simply be copied.

```json
"MyApp": {
   "kind": "bundle",
   "macosBundle": {
      "type": "app",
      "infoPropertyList": "platform/macos/Info.plist.json",
      "entitlementsPropertyList": "platform/macos/Entitlements.plist.json",
      "icon": "platform/macos/app-logo.png"
   }
}
```

The `infoPropertyList` defines an [Information Property List](//developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Introduction/Introduction.html) for the bundle. It can accept mulitple file extensions, such as a static `.plist` binary file, a `.json` file containing the data normally in a `.plist`, containing an object with key/value pairs. The json contents can be inlined directly into the [build file](/docs/the-build-file). If using either json route, one can use special variables that get resolved at the time of bundling (like with linux desktop entries). They are as follows:

| `${name}`           | The bundle's name, so in the examples above, this would be "MyApp" |
| `${bundleName}`     | The first 15 characters of ${name}, specifically used for [CFBundleName](//developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundlename) |
| `${mainExecutable}` | The main executable, explained [here](/docs/describing-the-distribution?id=the-main-executable) |
| `${icon}`           | The path to the icon. This ends up being the .icns created/copied in the distribution target's folder |

The `entitlementsPropertyList` defines an [Entitlements](//developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements) Property List for the bundle that defines special OS permissions required by the application during code signing. This is typical when linking against one of the various system frameworks. Like with the information property list, this property can accept multiple file extensions, such as a `.plist` or `.xml` file as long as the format is xml, or a `.json` file containing just an object with the entitlements and their values. The json data (or yaml) can also be inlined directly into the [build file](/docs/the-build-file).

> Note: If no entitlements are defined, and the application actually requires an entitlement, the application could silently fail when the .app has been opened. When this happens, you need to run the app through `/Applications/Utilities/Console.app` to find out which entitlements are required. For instance, to see them use the "Start streaming" option, and filter the message by your application's process name (not the bundle name).

Example with inlining:

```json
"MyApp": {
   "kind": "bundle",
   "macosBundle": {
      "type": "app",
      "infoPropertyList": {
         "CFBundleDevelopmentRegion": "en-US",
         "CFBundleDisplayName": "${name}",
         ...
      },
      "entitlementsPropertyList": {
         "com.apple.security.device.audio-input": false,
         "com.apple.developer.applesignin": [
            "..."
         ]
      },
      "icon": "platform/macos/app-logo.png"
   }
}
```

**Code Signing**

On Mac, the `signingIdentity` defined in Chalet's options is used as the identity during code signing. If it's blank, nothing will be signed, and Chalet will issue a warning. If it's filled in with a valid identity or hash, Both `macosBundle` types and plain bundles will be signed.

Notarization is not done at all. You will need to do that through a script.

> Note: This feature is still a work in-progress - Signing is a bit slow, but it works.

\\

## [Scripts, Processes, Validations]

Script, process, and validation targets all work the same way as their build target counterparts, so that one can do more with their distribution than what Chalet can offer. Refining the structure of the distribution folder, running additional programs, and generating additional files can be easily accomplished this way. As their distribution target counterparts work the same way, refer back to:

* [Script Targets](/docs/creating-targets?id=script-targets)
* [Process Targets](/docs/creating-targets?id=process-targets)
* [Validation Targets](/docs/creating-targets?id=validation-targets)

```json
"post-bundle": {
   "kind": "script",
   "file": "scripts/my_script.sh",
   "arguments": [
      "${distributionDir}/foo",
      "${meta:version}"
   ]
}
```

```json
"post-bundle": {
   "kind": "process",
   "path": "some-app",
   "arguments": [
      "--arg1",
      "--arg2"
   ]
}
```

```json
"pre-bundle": {
   "kind": "validation",
   "schema": "schema/content.schema.json",
   "files": "content/**.json"
}
```

\\

## [Archives]

Chalet can also generate zip archives as a distribution step with kind set to `archive`. The `include` property includes files relative to the distribution directory. If `"*"` is specified instead of an array, all files in the distribution directory up to that archive target will be included.

```json
"MyApp-archive": {
   "kind": "archive",
   "condition": "[:windows]",
   "format": "zip",
   "include": [
      "my-installer.exe",
      "LICENSE.txt"
      "README.md"
   ]
}
```

```json
"MyApp-archive": {
   "kind": "archive",
   "format": "zip",
   "include": [
      "${exce:my-app}"
   ]
}
```

```json
"MyApp-archive": {
   "kind": "archive",
   "format": "zip",
   "include": "*"
}
```

This is equivalent to running `zip` in the command line on Linux/Mac, and Powershell's `Compress-Archive` on Windows. The `format` can be changed to `tar` to create a tarball (with .tar.gz extension).

On macOS, a `zip` archive can be notarized with Apple so it can be distributed. Please note that this also requires the app to be codesigned. Additionally, a keychain profile needs to be setup using:

```bash
# Change 'MyProfile' to the profile name for your app
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "MyProfile" --apple-id "$APPLE_ID" --password "$APP_PWD" --team-id "$TEAM_ID"
```

If unfamiliar with this process, see [this page](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution/customizing_the_notarization_workflow) for an intro. To notarize using a keychain profile, simply add `macosNotarizationProfile` with the name of the profile:

```json
"MyApp-archive": {
   "kind": "archive",
   "format": "zip",
   "include": "*",
   "macosNotarizationProfile": "MyProfile"
}
```

alternatively, a substitution variable can be used. The below will only notarize if `NOTARIZATION_PROFILE` is defined:

```json
"macosNotarizationProfile": "${env:NOTARIZATION_PROFILE}"
```

\\

## [MacOS Disk Images]

On MacOS, it's very common to distribute an application bundle inside of a DMG. Chalet provides a nice abstraction to do this with. Simply set the kind to `macosDiskImage` and provide some details about the image itself. The DMG always uses the "icon" view

Instead of defining "includes" like with bundles or archives, the `positions` imply two things: the application bundles or files to include in the DMG, and the position to display them at in the DMG image. Use only files that have been copied to the dist folder in a previous distribution target.


```json
"post-bundle": {
   "kind": "macosDiskImage",
   "pathbarVisible": false,
   "textSize": 12,
   "iconSize": 80,
   "background": {
      "1x": "platform/macos/dmg-background.png",
      "2x": "platform/macos/dmg-background@2x.png"
   },
   "size": {
      "width": 512,
      "height": 342
   },
   "positions": {
      "MyApp": {
         "x": 120,
         "y": 188
      },
      "Applications": {
         "x": 392,
         "y": 188
      }
   }
}
```
