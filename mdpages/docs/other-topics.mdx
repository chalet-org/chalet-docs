Additional topics will be covered here. These will typically be features that don't quite fit anywhere else, or ones that are just plain experimental and need more testing.

\\

## [The Run Environment]

When an application runs through Chalet, some extra paths get added to the environment -- mainly for finding shared libraries -- and it may be desirable to use this environment somewhere, or simply read it. For this purpose, the build will generate a `run.env` file. For example, the [VS Code C/C++ debugger](/integrations/visual-studio-code?id=debugging) can use this file when debugging one of your executables.

## [C++20 Modules]

C++20 modules are an exciting, new frontier in the wild world of C++, however, they're still being implemented by compilers. At the moment, Chalet supports modules with MSVC, and has partial support for GCC and Clang.

\

**MSVC**

Modules have a complicated build process compared to other C++ code, so they are built natively through Chalet, instead of using Ninja/Make. Fortunately, this is very fast, and comparable to doing so in msbuild or within Visual Studio. If the build strategy is set to `ninja` or `makefile`, other build targets will still use them, and module targets will ignore that strategy and use its own. 

Because module source code file extensions can technically be anything in the same way as regular C++ code, it makes the most sense to separate out the two types of source code in the build into separate targets, and define the extensions in [Files](/docs/creating-targets?id=adding-source-files) how you'd like them to be. A traditional C++ file in a module target would get treated as a module otherwise.

Also of note, standard library header imports are supported without any additional settings, so feel free to `import <iostream>` or `import std` in C++23 mode.

To get started with modules, initialize a project with `chalet init` and answer **yes** to **Enable C++20 modules?** in the questionnaire.

As of Visual Studio 17.5 and above in C++23 mode, one can use standard library modules:

| std | Module containing the C++ STL |
| std.compat | Module containing compatible global C functions |

Comprehensive documentation about these features can be found [here](//learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/tutorial-import-stl-named-module?view=msvc-170).

> Notes: `import std` and `import std.compat` is a bit like a precompiled header in that they require a longer build up-front and require rebuilding if they are changed between VS versions. Unlike one, they use a lot less space on disk. 

\

**GCC (limited support)**

Modules require at least GCC version 11, although you are probably going to want to pick the latest version, as support for them is still being added. The current iteration utilizes `-fmodules-ts` and `-fmodule-mapper`, and currently generates its own module mappings to keep the build folder structure consistent. This is still somewhat experimental, and will be given more attention in the future as the GCC implementation gets closer to the C++20 standard.

From testing, it looks like [private module fragments](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/modules#Private_module_fragment) and module partition units are unimplemented as of GCC 14. C++23 standard library modules are also unimplemented.

\

**Clang (limited support)**

Modules in Clang require at least version 16, and have even less support, as user header units are unimplemented as of Clang 19. As with GCC, this implementation is considered experimental.

\

**Modules example project**

A crude example project was created during the development of Chalet to implement and test out module features on each of the above compilers. While it's not a serious project, it showcases as many of the new patterns as possible. It's setup across 3 branches, with one branch dedicated to each compiler. It can be reviewed below:

## [Intel Compilers]

Intel compilers are currently supported on Windows and MacOS.

[[tabs:start]]
|Windows|

Their latest compiler suite, Intel oneAPI (based on LLVM) is supported. It can be selected with the following toolchain presets:

| intel-llvm-vs-2022 | Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler with Visual Studio 2022 environment |
| intel-llvm-vs-2019 | Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler with Visual Studio 2019 environment |

Additionally Chalet requires that the `ONEAPI_ROOT` be set. This should be automatically set in the installer, but if it isn't, this is the root oneAPI directory (ie. something like `C:\Intel\oneAPI\`). This variable is used to find the `setvars.bat` script, responsible for creating the build environment used by the compiler (which also inherits a Visual Studio environment).

If this file is not found, the build will fail.

|MacOS|

On MacOS, "Intel Compiler Classic" must be installed, and obviously requires a mac with an intel processor.

| intel-classic | Intel® C++ Compiler Classic (for x86_64 processors) |

This may change, but at the moment, Chalet looks for a file called `setvars.sh`, which is responsible for creating the build environment used by the compiler. This script is checked in the following directories:

```
$HOME/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
/opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
```

If it's not found in either location, the build will fail.

## [Emscripten]

In addition to following the steps on the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started?id=settings-overview) page, there's a few more details to discuss regarding [Emscripten](//emscripten.org).

Firstly, executable targets produce a `.wasm`, `.js` and `.html` file of the target so that the build can be tested easily as a server. By simply running `chalet buildrun`, a local server will startup through [emrun](//emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Running-html-files-with-emrun.html). If you would like to change the port the server runs on, add a `.env` file with the following:

```env
EMRUN_PORT=8080
```

The server will run continuously until it's canceled with `CTRL+C`. It's expected that Chalet will honor this and exit the server and itself gracefully afterwards.

Emscripten considers the html template used to launch a wasm file the "shell", and what you might want to setup is a [custom shell](//emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Deploying-Pages.html#build-files-and-custom-shell) with your own design and css. In order to do this, simply add it to the `linkerOptions`:

```json
"linkerOptions[toolchain:emscripten]": [
   "--shell-file",
   "path/custom-shell.html"
]
```

Alternatively, you might want to keep the wasm compilation completely seperate from the rest of the website you're using it with, so the shell would be less important in that case.

Debugging an emscripten application is a little more complicated. When using `-c Debug` at the command-line, this will generate a debug build as expected, along with a source map file that will map the WebAssembly text format you would see in the browser's debugger to the C/C++ source file. What this means is that the entire project directory will launch as a server, so that those source files can be resolved by the source map during debugging. Upon running, Chalet will output the directory path that will go right to the run target that was selected.

> Note: this behavior may change as support for this toolchain improves

## [Unicode Support]

As of version 0.8.4, support for Unicode in various areas have been added.
Limitations:

- CMake supports Unicode paths, but not Unicode target names. It may error with the following:

```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (add_executable):
  The target name "夢想家たち" is reserved or not valid for certain
  CMake features, such as generator expressions, and may result in undefined
  behavior.
```

- MinGW and `mingw32-make.exe` do not support unicode targets or paths pretty much at all
- You can generate a [Code::Blocks](/integrations/code-blocks) project on Windows, open it, but it will not build (see 2)
- Certain ninja versions have Unicode issues on Windows (v1.10 and prior it seems)

Additional notes:

- Visual Studio .sln files and NMake build files require BOM.

\\

## [Continuous Integration]

At the moment, Chalet looks for `CI=1` or `CI=true` and makes a couple adjustments during its run. For example, fancier output, like loading ellipses, are disabled.

\\

## [Package Managers]

At the moment, other package managers like [Conan](//conan.io) and [vcpkg](//vcpkg.io) can be integrated using [Process Targets](/docs/creating-targets?id=process-targets), [Script Targets](/docs/creating-targets?id=script-targets), or they can invoked via CMake in [CMake Targets](/docs/creating-targets?id=cmake-targets), but there is no official integration for them.
