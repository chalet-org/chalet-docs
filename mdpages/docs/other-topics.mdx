Additional topics will be covered here. These will typically be features that don't quite fit anywhere else, or ones that are just plain experimental and need more testing.

\\

## [The Run Environment]

When an application runs through Chalet, some extra paths get added to the environment -- mainly for finding shared libraries -- and it may be desirable to use this environment somewhere, or simply read it. For this purpose, the build will generate a `run.env` file. For example, the [VS Code C/C++ debugger](/integrations/visual-studio-code?id=debugging) can use this file when debugging one of your executables.

## [C++20 Modules]

C++20 modules are an exciting, new frontier in the wild world of C++, and it's still gaining support from compilers. At the moment, Chalet only supports modules with MSVC.

Modules have a complicated build process compared to other C++ code, so they are built natively through Chalet, instead of using Ninja/Make. Fortunately, this is very fast, and comparable to doing so in msbuild or within Visual Studio. If the build strategy is set to `ninja` or `makefile`, other build targets will still use them, and module targets will ignore that strategy and use its own. 

Because module source code file extensions can technically be anything in the same way as regular C++ code, it makes the most sense to separate out the two types of source code in the build into separate targets, and define the extensions in [Files](/docs/creating-targets?id=adding-source-files) how you'd like them to be. A traditional C++ file in a module target would get treated as a module otherwise.

Also of note, standard library header imports are supported without any additional settings, so feel free to `import <iostream>`. 

To get started with modules, initialize a project with `chalet init` and answer **yes** to **Enable C++20 modules?** in the questionnaire.

## [Intel Compilers]

Intel compilers are currently supported on Windows and MacOS.

<!-- tabs:start -->
|Windows|

Their latest compiler suite, Intel oneAPI (based on LLVM) is supported. It can be selected with the following toolchain presets:

* `intel-llvm-vs-2019`
* `intel-llvm-vs-2017`

Additionally Chalet requires that the `ONEAPI_ROOT` be set. This should be automatically set in the installer, but if it isn't, this is the root oneAPI directory (ie. something like `C:\Intel\oneAPI\`). This variable is used to find the `setvars.bat` script, responsible for creating the build environment used by the compiler (which also inherits a Visual Studio environment).

If this file is not found, the build will fail.

|MacOS|

On MacOS, "Intel Compiler Classic" must be installed, and obviously requires a mac with an intel processor.

* `intel-classic`

This may change, but at the moment, Chalet looks for a file called `setvars.sh`, which is responsible for creating the build environment used by the compiler. This script is checked in the following directories:

* `$HOME/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
* `/opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`

If it's not found in either location, the build will fail.

## [Continuous Integration]

At the moment, Chalet looks for `CI=1` or `CI=true` and makes a couple adjustments during its run. The main thing that changes is that the build strategy used is `native-experimental`. Although it is experimental, the only thing the native strategy doesn't do yet is dependency checks. Additionally, any irregular output, like loading ellipses, are disabled.

\\

## [Package Managers]

At the moment, other package managers like [Conan](//conan.io) and [vcpkg](//vcpkg.io) can be integrated using [Process Targets](/docs/creating-targets?id=process-targets), [Script Targets](/docs/creating-targets?id=script-targets), or they can invoked via CMake in [CMake Targets](/docs/creating-targets?id=cmake-targets), but there is no official integration for them.
