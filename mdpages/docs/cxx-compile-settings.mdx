In source targets, C/C++ settings may be described in a similar fashion as one would if they were interacting with a compiler from the command line. This is designed to be as intuitive and straightforward as possible, while maintaining the same flexibility.


```json
"targets": {
   "my-project": {
      "kind": "executable",
      "language": "C++",
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "precompiledHeader": "src/PCH.hpp",
         "cppStandard": "c++20",
         "warningsPreset": "strict",
         "threads": true,
         "runtimeTypeInformation": false,
         "exceptions": true,
         "staticLinking": false,
         "defines": [
            "LIB_FOO"
         ],
         "defines[:debug]": [
            "_DEBUG"
         ],
         "includeDirs": [
            "${externalDir:foo}/include",
            "${externalDir:bar}/include"
         ],
         "libDirs": [
            "${externalDir:foo}/lib"
         ],
         "links": [
            "foo"
         ],
         "links[:windows]": [
            "bar"
         ]
      },
      "files": "src/**.cpp"
   }
}
```

Some of these properties will be covered here, while others will be explained are detailed in the schema documentation, [here](http://localhost:3000/schema/latest/chalet-json/executable-source-target).

\\

## [Language Standard]

The C and C++ language standard are represented as `cStandard` and `cppStandard` respectively. If using GCC and clang, the language standard is given directly to the compiler, while if using MSVC, it's reinterpreted to a supported flag.

Examples:

```json
// /std:c++20 in MSVC (19.29 or higher)
"cppStandard": "c++20"
"cppStandard": "gnu++2b"

// /std:c++17 in MSVC (19.11 or higher)
"cppStandard": "c++17" 

// /std:c17 in MSVC (19.28 or higher)
"cStandard": "gnu17"

// /std:c11 in MSVC (19.28 or higher)
"cStandard": "c11"
```

MSVC will fall back to `/std:latest` if the standard isn't recognized.

> Note: With this approach, One can try out new C++ versions without needing an update of chalet first

\\

## [Include Directories]

These are directories (preferably relative) to be included during compilation, and tell the compiler where header files are located. This is expressed with the `includeDirs` property, where all [Variable Substitution](/docs/creating-targets?id=variable-substitution) and glob patterns apply. The simplest example is the following:

```json
"includeDirs": [
   "src"
]
```

This means the `src` folder is a root of included paths, so folders are required in `#include` directives.

```cpp
#include "foo.hpp"         // src/foo.hpp
#include "bar/bar.hpp"     // src/folder/bar.hpp
```

```json
"includeDirs": [
   "${externalDir:foo}/include",
]
```

Typically this means if a library has subdirectories, you have to declare your include directives in code as: 

```cpp
#include <subdir/foo.hpp>  // ${externalDir:foo}/include/subdir/foo.hpp
```

Some might want to do the following:

```cpp
#include <foo.hpp>         // ${externalDir:foo}/include/subdir/foo.hpp
#include "bar.hpp"         // src/folder/bar.hpp
```

Glob patterns are also supported for this reason, so one can include a directory recursively:

```json
"includeDirs": [
   "${externalDir:foo}/include/**",
   "src/**"
]
```

However, the problem with this approach is that simply adding a folder will add another include path to the build command, forcing a recompile of that target, so it would be more desirable to either place all sources in a single folder, or use the previous subfolder approach. This would ultimately come down to personal preference.

> Note: compiler include paths are automatically added.

\\

## [Build Suffixes]

The build suffix is a simple mechanism to share compiled objects between multiple source targets. By default, the following directory structures are used:

| `(buildOutputDir)/obj.(suffix)` | Compiled objects |
| `(buildOutputDir)/asm.(suffix)` | Object disassemblies (optional) |
| `(buildDir)/int.(suffix)` | Intermediate files (shared among build configurations) |

Without changing anything, the suffix is the name of the source target. Changing the `buildSuffix` property to a previous build target name will share the object files between the two targets. One use case for this could be tests, where there's a main executable and a tests executable. This would be configured like so:

```json
"first-target": {
   "kind": "executable",
   "files": [
      "src/*/**.cpp", // all subfolders in src
      "src/main.cpp" // main in src
   ],
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "includeDirs": [
         "src"
      ]
   }
},
"second-target": {
   "kind": "executable",
   "files": [
      "src/*/**.cpp", // all subfolders in src
      "test/**.cpp" // all tests (and its own main)
   ],
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "buildSuffix": "first-target", // use the same folders as the first target
      "includeDirs": [
         "src",
         "test"
      ]
   }
}
```

> Note: `files` in `first-target` could also be written as `src/**.cpp`, but it's split up for clarity.

An original build suffix can also be set for related targets where its appropriate. For example, `"buildSuffix": "sources"` in both of the targets above.

\\

## [Library Search Paths]

These are directories (preferably relative) that are used to search for static or dynamic libraries at link time. If you're looking to link a library called `foo`, you must tell the linker where `foo.lib` or `libfoo.a` exist. This is expressed with the `libDirs` property, where all [Variable Substitution](/docs/creating-targets?id=variable-substitution) and glob patterns are supported.

Example:

```json
"libDirs": [
   "${externalBuildDir:foo}/lib"
]
"libDirs[:windows]": [
   "${env:ProgramFiles}/bar/lib"
]
"libDirs[:!windows]": [
   "~/libraries/bar/lib"
]
```

> Note: compiler lib paths are automatically added.

\\

## [Preprocessor Definitions]

These are preprocessor symbols to pass to the compiler **per target**. These are typically used to define something globally that affects how the target gets compiled for its usage. 

For example, in a debug build, you're probably going to want to define `DEBUG` or `_DEBUG` (this is not done for you).

```json
"abstracts:*": {
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "defines[:debug]": [
         "_DEBUG"
      ]
   }
}
```

\\

## [Warnings]

Deciding which warnings to use is a central part of working with C++. There are two ways to declare them: As a preset, or as a GNU-style list.

\

**Warning Presets**

Presets are inherently opinionated. Their goal is to provide an abstraction that can be interpreted by all compilers. With GCC & clang, they will populate a list of warnings behinds the scenes, try to limit them based on the compiler version, and pass them along. Both compilers tend to support each other in that if a warning is available on one, but not the other, it tends to just be a no-op. When in doubt: test.

```json
"my-target": {
   "settings:Cxx": {
     "warningsPreset": "strict"
   }
}
```

|                 | GCC / Clang | MSVC  |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| none (default)  | No warnings       | No warnings |
| minimal         | `-Wall`       | `/W1` |
| extra           | **minimal** + `-Wextra`       | `/W2` |
| pedantic        | **extra** + `-Wpedantic`      | `/W3` |
| strict          | **pedantic** + `-Wunused` `-Wcast-align` `-Wdouble-promotion` `-Wformat=2` `-Wmissing-declarations` `-Wmissing-include-dirs` `-Wnon-virtual-dtor` `-Wredundant-decls`       | `/W4` |
| strictPedantic  | **strict** + `-Wunreachable-code` `-Wshadow`    | `/W4` |
| veryStrict      | **strictPedantic** + `-Wnoexcept` `-Wundef` `-Wconversion` `-Wcast-qual` `-Wfloat-equal` `-Winline` `-Wold-style-cast` `-Wstrict-null-sentinel` `-Woverloaded-virtual` `-Wsign-conversion` `-Wsign-promo`    | `/W4` |

> Note: In MSVC, if you'd like to use `/Wall`, it must be added manually.

> Note: These may change between some Chalet versions (probably not very often), as they have the potential to be pretty contentious. [Debate](//github.com/chalet-org/chalet/discussions) is welcomed.

\

**Explicit GNU-style List**

Warnings can be defined manually, as a list of their GNU names, minus the `-W` prefix. If the compiler is GCC or clang, the list is passed along directly to the compile commands, without any further validation (although this behavior may get tweaked in the future).

```json
"my-target": {
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "warnings": [
         "all",
         "unused",
         "shadow",
         "unreachable-code",
         "format=2"
      ]
   }
}
```

In MSVC, warning flags will be cross-referenced based on the the presets above, so if "pedantic" is present in the list, the flag will be `/W3`. 

**Warnings as Errors**

To enable warnings as errrs, sipmly set `treatWarningsAsErrors` to true. It's equivalent to adding "error" to the warning list.

```json
"my-target": {
   "settings:Cxx": {
     "treatWarningsAsErrors": true
   }
}
```
\\

## [Precompiled Headers]

For the unfamiliar, this is a convention used to speed up the build process by compiling common headers up front. A single precompiled header can be defined per source target using the `precompiledHeader` property. One can include as many headers as they wish to inside of the precompiled header itself.

```json
"my-target": {
   "files": "src/**.cpp",
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "precompiledHeader": "src/PCH.hpp"
   }
}
```

This will automatically include that header in every source file of that target. Although there's nothing stopping one from doing so, it's not necessary to include it again at the top of source files via `#include`. Every compiler handles precompiled headers a little differently under the hood, so Chalet abstracts that away for you.

> Note: In `universal` architecture builds on MacOS, a separate precompiled header is created for each architecture.

\\

## [Dynamic Linking]

Linking shared libraries is quite simple in Chalet. Like with the `-l` option in GCC/Clang, only the base name of the library needs to be supplied. Thus, `libfoo.a` would be linked as `foo`. If you are using MSVC, and the library is `foo.lib`, the link is again just `foo`.

```json
"links": [
   "foo"
],
"links[:debug]": [
   "bar-d"
],
"links[:!debug]": [
   "bar"
],
"links[:windows]": [
   "user32"
]
```

If linking to another target, the target must build prior to the current target, and one only needs to supply the target name to `links`.

```json
"first-target": {
   "kind": "sharedLibrary",
   "files": "src/foo/**.cpp",
},
"second-target": {
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "links": [
         "first-target"
      ]
   }
}
```

You might run into a situation where a library is only supported on a certain platform, or is only relevant in a Debug build. Expressing that is quite easy:

```json
"first-target": {
   "kind": "sharedLibrary",
   "condition": "[:windows]",
   "files": "src/foo/**.cpp"
},
"second-target": {
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "links[:windows]": [
         "first-target"
      ]
   }
```

\\

## [Static Linking]

Static links work the same way as shared, but use the `staticLinks` property instead.

```json
"first-target": {
   "kind": "staticLibrary",
   "files": "src/foo/**.cpp"
},
"second-target": {
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "staticLinks": [
         "first-target"
      ]
   }
}
```

The actual file being linked in that example is either `libfirst-target.a` or `first-target.lib` depending on the compiler, but the target name is what's important to `staticLinks`.

\\

## [Static Runtime Libraries]

For the unfamiliar: when an application or shared library is linked, one can choose whether the runtime is linked dynamically (default) or statically. This means additional shared library dependencies. In Chalet, there's an extra property for this: `staticRuntimeLibrary`, and has slightly different behavior on each toolchain.

In GCC, the following flags are used:

```bash
-static-libgcc
-static-libstdc++
```

Depending on the sanitizers used by the build configuration, the following will also be enabled:

```bash
-static-libasan  # address
-static-libtsan  # thread
-static-liblsan  # leaks
-static-libubsan # undefined
```

In LLVM, `-static-libsan` is used alongside sanitize=address at the moment with `staticRuntimeLibrary`.

On linux, statically linking the runtime libraries may not be wise, but in the case of MinGW on Windows, it means not having to ship your application with files like `libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`, `libstdc++-6.dll` and `libpthread-1.dll`.

In MSVC, `/MTd` is passed instead of `/MDd` in debug builds, and `/MT` is passed instead of `/MD` in non-debug builds. statically linking the runtime libraries in MSVC means not requiring `api-ms-win-crt-*.dll` files when it comes time to distribute


\\

## [C++ Modules]

To enable modules (requires C++20 - currently only works with MSVC), set `cppModules` to true. This will treat **all** source files in that target location as modules. 

```json
"modules-target": {
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "cppModules": true
   }
}
```

If mixing with non-module C++ code, one must create a static library target without `cppModules`, import those headers in your module code, and statically link the non-modules target.

```json
"non-modules-target": {
   "kind": "staticLibrary",
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "includeDirs": [
         "include/foo"
      ]
   },
   "files": "src/foo/**.cpp"
},
"modules-target": {
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "cppModules": true,
      "includeDirs": [
         "include/foo"
      ],
      "staticLinks": [
         "non-modules-target"
      ]
   },
   "files": "src/bar/**.cpp"
}
```
