title: The Settings File

# [${meta.title}]

---

From a high level, settings in Chalet are anything specific to the local development environment. These can be options for customizing the build experience, custom toolchains, as well as other executable paths Chalet requires to function.

\\

## [Overview]

There are two types of settings files:

| .chalet/config | Global settings (generated in the `HOME` directory) |
| .chaletrc | Local settings (generated in the project directory) |

Both contain the same structure, and for the most part are designed to be managed by Chalet, but a user can go in and change options and paths manually if they wish.

The global settings file is designed to be generated first, with some defaults and some basic structuring. Local settings on the other hand are specific to each project. When a project is configured, the global settings are copied into local settings first, then local settings are updated based on command line inputs. 

If a user wants to define a compiler toolchain for a specific project, they would do so in local settings. Otherwise if they want to import that configuration into each project upon configuring, they would add the toolchain to global settings.

The basic layout is as follows:

```json
{
   "options": { ... },
   "toolchains": { ... },
   "tools": { ... },
   "appleSdks": { ... }, // MacOS only
   "theme": "default"
}
```

\\

## [Options]

The first block is the options, and most of them will be familiar, because with a couple exceptions, they mirror the [Build Actions](/docs/command-usage?id=build-actions) command-line options.

```json
"options": {
   "dumpAssembly": false,
   "showCommands": false,
   "benchmark": true,

## [Toolchains]

The `toolchains` structure describes a toolchain that has either been detected from a given preset at the command line (for instance, `-t llvm -a x86_64`) or a toolchain manually defined by a user. When a toolchain is generated, the best available executable candidates are found, but it may sometimes be necessary to check and make changes.

Below is an example toolchain that generates for `apple-llvm` on MacOS.

```json
"toolchains": {
   "apple-llvm": {
      "version": "13.1.6",
      "strategy": "ninja",
      "buildPathStyle": "target-triple",
      "compilerCpp": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang++",
      "compilerC": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang",
      "compilerWindowsResource": "",
      "linker": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/ld",
      "archiver": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/libtool",
      "profiler": "",
      "disassembler": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/otool",
      "cmake": "/usr/local/bin/cmake",
      "make": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/make",
      "ninja": "/usr/local/bin/ninja"
   }
}
```

Paths for `cmake`, `make` and `ninja` are part of the toolchains so that one can define bundled versions (in the case of Visual Studio), or other drop-in replacements.

<!-- dl:start -->

``version``

<dd>

A version string to identify the toolchain. If MSVC, this must be the full version string of the Visual Studio Installation. (vswhere's installationVersion string)

</dd>

``strategy``

<dd>

The strategy to use during the build. When the toolchain is generated, it defaults to `ninja` (if detected), but falls back to `makefile` otherwise. If building on a CI server, it will default to `native-experimental` but expects no existing builds present. 

| ninja                | Uses the Ninja version defined by the `ninja` property. |
| makefile             | Uses the GNU Make version defined by the `make` property. |
| native-experimental  | Experimental support to build entirely with Chalet. |

</dd>

``buildPathStyle``

<dd>

The build path style, with the configuration appended following an underscore. Examples:

| configuration  | ex: `build/Debug` |
| architecture   | ex: `build/x64_Debug` |
| target-triple  | ex: `build/x64-linux-gnu_Debug` |
| toolchain-name | ex: `build/my-cool-toolchain_name_Debug` |

</dd>

``compilerCpp``

<dd>

The executable path to the toolchain's C++ compiler.

</dd>

``compilerC``

<dd>

The executable path to the toolchain's C compiler.

</dd>

``compilerWindowsResource``

<dd>

The executable path to the resource compiler. This can be either rc.exe, llvm-rc.exe, or windres.exe. Cross-compiling via MinGW on Linux is supported.

</dd>

``linker``

<dd>

The executable path to the toolchain's linker - typically ld with GCC, lld with LLVM, or link.exe with Visual Studio.

</dd>

``archiver``

<dd>

The executable path to the toolchain's static library archive utility - typically ar with GCC, libtool on MacOS, or lib.exe with Visual Studio.

</dd>

``profiler``

<dd>

The executable path to the toolchain's command-line profiler (if applicable) - for instance, gprof with GCC.

</dd>

``disassembler``

<dd>

The executable path to the toolchain's disassembler (if applicable) - for instance, objdump with GCC, dumpbin with MSVC, and otool with Apple LLVM.

</dd>

``cmake``

<dd>

The executable path to CMake.

</dd>

``make``

<dd>

The executable path to GNU make, or NMAKE/Qt Jom with Visual Studio.

</dd>

``ninja``

<dd>

The executable path to Ninja.

</dd>

<!-- dl:end -->

\\

## [Tools]

The `tools` structure includes paths to any other executables required on the platform. Chalet will detect whatever has priority in the PATH variable, but any resulting paths need to be changed, this can be done after configuring and before building.

Here's some example paths on MacOS:

```json
"tools": {
   "bash": "/bin/bash",
   "codesign": "/usr/bin/codesign",
   "git": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/git",
   "hdiutil": "/usr/bin/hdiutil",
   "install_name_tool": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/install_name_tool",
   "osascript": "/usr/bin/osascript",
   "otool": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/otool",
   "plutil": "/usr/bin/plutil",
   "sample": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/sample",
   "sips": "/usr/bin/sips",
   "tiffutil": "/usr/bin/tiffutil",
   "xcodebuild": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild",
   "xcrun": "/usr/bin/xcrun",
   "zip": "/usr/bin/zip"
}
```

\\

## [Apple SDKs]

(MacOS only)

On MacOS, The SDK paths are cached so that user can tweak them if they wish. Paths are generated for: `appletvos` `appletvsimulator` `macosx` `watchos` `watchsimulator` `iphoneos` and `iphonesimulator`.

For instance, If xcode-select is set to use Xcode, the `macosx` path may resolve to the following:

```json
"appleSdks": {
   "macosx": "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX12.3.sdk",
   ...
}
```

At the moment, these are used based on the given target architecture of the build, so if the triple ends with an id specified below, the matching SDK path will be used as the `sysroot` during compilation.

| Architecture triple ends with: | SDK: |
| ------------------------------ | ---- |
| `darwin` `darwin##` `macosx` or `macosx##` | `macosx` |
| `ios` or `ios##` | `iphoneos` |
| `tvos` or `tvos##`       | `appletvos` |
| `watchos` or `watchos##` | `watchos` |

> Note: Anything other than `macosx` is experimental. Although SDK paths for simulators are generated, actual support will be a future addition.

\\

## [Themes]

The `theme` property can either be a preset string or an object of key/value pairs that describe the theme.

Details of each can be viewed in the latest schema [here](/schema/latest/settings-json?id=theme).

```json
"theme": "default"
```

> Note: Run `chalet termtest` in order to see what the theme presets look like.

```json
"theme": {
   "info": "reset",
   "flair": "black",
   "header": "brightYellowBold",
   "build": "brightBlue",
   "assembly": "brightMagenta",
   "success": "brightGreenBold",
   "error": "brightRedBold",
   "warning": "brightYellowBold",
   "note": "brightCyanBold"
}
```

To disable the theme, set `theme` to `none`.
