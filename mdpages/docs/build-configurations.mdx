Build configurations in Chalet control some of the key properties of the build, like the optimization level, debug symbols, sanitizers, and profiling - anything that requires a distinct build, but isn't specific to the project being built.

\\

## [Overview]

In the [build file](/docs/the-build-file), one can use the `defaultConfigurations` to narrow down which of the default build configurations that are allowed in the project. Chalet contains several default build configurations:


```json
"defaultConfigurations": [
   "Release",
   "Debug",
   "RelWithDebInfo",
   "MinSizeRel",
   "RelHighOpt",
   "Profile"
   "DebugSanitize",
   "DebugSanitizeAddress",
   "DebugSanitizeThread",
   "DebugSanitizeMemory",
   "DebugSanitizeLeak",
   "DebugSanitizeUndefined",
   "DebugSanitizeHW",
   "DebugSanitizeHWAddress",
   "ReleaseSanitizeUndefined"
]
```

\

Build configurations themselves are defined with the `configurations` property. This way, one can say "use a handful of the defaults, but define my own `Release` configuration," or possibly "use no defaults, and define my own configurations" altogether. 

An example build configuration is as follows:

```json
"configurations": {
   "Release": {
      "optimizationLevel": "2",
      "debugSymbols": false,
      "interproceduralOptimization": false,
      "enableProfiling": false,
      "sanitize": false
   }
}
```

In each build configuration, these are several available properties.

\\

## [Optimization Level]


The first one is the `optimizationLevel`. It defines the optimization level passed into the compiler, and mostly follows GNU conventions. Thus, the expected values are `0` `1` `2` `3` `debug` `size` and `fast`. If the property is omitted, no optimization level will be used (implying the compiler's default). 

The mapping for these are more or less 1:1:

|       | GCC / Clang | MSVC  |
| ----- | ----------- | ----- |
| 0     | `-O0`       | `/Od` |
| 1     | `-O1`       | `/O1` |
| 2     | `-O2`       | `/O2` |
| 3     | `-O3`       | `/Ox` |
| debug | `-Od`       | `/Od` |
| size  | `-Os`       | `/Os` |
| fast  | `-Ofast`    | `/Ot` |

> Note: To understand each optimization level further, refer to your compiler's documentation.

## [Debug Symbols]

The `debugSymbols` property is a boolean value that determines whether the build will contain symbols required for debugging. In GCC/Clang, this will apply the `-g3` compiler option, which includes everything that `-g` does, along with macro expansion support.

In MSVC, this triggers several compiler options that will produce a similar build on Windows machines (and `*.pdb` files).

> Note: Preprocessor definitions such as `_DEBUG` `DEBUG` and `NDEBUG` are **not** automatically defined. You will need to add them per project.

\\

## [Interprocedural Optimization]

If the `interproceduralOptimization` property is set to true, whole-program optimizations and/or link-time optimizations will be considered. In general, it means more optimizations can be performed on the binary, but require a newer compiler version (MSVC >= 19.30, GCC >= 9.x). The following compile options are used:

|       | Compiler | Linker | Archiver |
| ----- | -------- | ------ | -------- |
| MSVC  | `/GL` | `/LTCG:INCREMENTAL` `/LTCGOUT:file.iobj` | `/LTCG` |
| GCC   | `--fno-fat-lto-objects` `-flto` | `-flto` | -- |
| Clang | -- | -- | -- |

> Note: Clang support will be investigated in the future.

In all cases, further optimizations are performed on the binaries, but in the case of MSVC, it means quicker compile times. The one caveat being that dumping the assembly of individual objects becomes impossible, because with the current technique, it's done after the objects are created. The only default configuration that uses interprocedural optimizations is `RelHighOpt`.
 
\\

## [Enable Profiling]

If `enableProfiling` is set to true, profiling features are enabled. This is different on each compiler toolchain, but in general: profiling flags are added to the build, and running the target invokes a profiler if available instead of simply running the binary.

|              | Compiler | Linker | Profiler |
| ------------ | -------- | ------ | -------- |
| MSVC         | --       | `/profile` | Generates a `.vsp`, launches in Visual Studio Instruments |
| Apple Clang  | --       | --     | Generates in `xctrace` or cli `instruments`, launches in Xcode Instruments if using XCode's path with xcode-select. Falls back to `sample` |
| GCC          | `-pg`    | `-pg`  | Launches in `gprof` if available |
| MinGW        | `-pg`    | `-pg`  | Launches in `gprof` if available, but won't work with many MinGW distributions. |
| Clang        | `-pg`    | `-pg`  | Launches in `gprof` if available, but Windows Clang does not have a default. |


\\

## [Sanitizers]

Chalet provides a way to enable sanitizers, if available by the compiler toolchain and platform. If not using any sanitizers in the build configuration, one can set the `sanitize` property to `false`, otherwise, this property can either take a single sanitizer or an array of compatible sanitizers.

Accepted values are:

| **address**   | Address sanitizer (MSVC, Clang, AppleClang, GCC) |
| **undefined** | Undefined behavior sanitizer (Clang, AppleClang, GCC) |
| **leak**      | Leak sanitizer (Clang, GCC) |
| **thread**    | Thread sanitizer (Clang, AppleClang, GCC) |
| **memory**    | Memory sanitizer (Clang) |
| **hwaddress** | Hardwar-assisted address sanitizer (Clang, GCC - arm64 targets only) |


If using `staticRuntimeLibrary` in the compile settings, certain sanitizers can be statically linked.

> Note: Sanitizers in MinGW and Intel Classic are not supported.

## [Default Configurations]

With the above in mind, if we were to imagine the default build configurations defined in our build file, it would look like the following:

```json
"configurations": {
   "Release": {
      "optimizationLevel": "2",
      "debugSymbols": false,
      "interproceduralOptimization": false,
      "enableProfiling": false,
      "sanitize": false
   },
   "Debug": {
      "optimizationLevel": "0",
      "debugSymbols": true,
      "interproceduralOptimization": false,
      "enableProfiling": false,
      "sanitize": false
   },
   "RelWithDebInfo": {
      "optimizationLevel": "2",
      "debugSymbols": true,
      "interproceduralOptimization": false,
      "enableProfiling": false,
      "sanitize": false
   },
   "MinSizeRel": {
      "optimizationLevel": "size",
      "debugSymbols": false,
      "interproceduralOptimization": false,
      "enableProfiling": false,
      "sanitize": false
   },
   "RelHighOpt": {
      "optimizationLevel": "3",
      "debugSymbols": false,
      "interproceduralOptimization": true,
      "enableProfiling": false,
      "sanitize": false
   },
   "Profile": {
      "optimizationLevel": "0",
      "debugSymbols": true,
      "interproceduralOptimization": false,
      "enableProfiling": true,
      "sanitize": false
   },
   "DebugSanitize": {
      // Same as 'Debug'
      "sanitize": [
         "address",
         "undefined",
         "leak",
      ]
   },
   "DebugSanitizeAddress": {
      // Same as 'Debug'
      "sanitize": "address"
   },
   "DebugSanitizeThread": {
      // Same as 'Debug'
      "sanitize": "thread"
   },
   "DebugSanitizeMemory": {
      // Same as 'Debug'
      "sanitize": "memory"
   },
   "DebugSanitizeLeak": {
      // Same as 'Debug'
      "sanitize": "leak"
   },
   "DebugSanitizeUndefined": {
      // Same as 'Debug'
      "sanitize": "undefined"
   },
   "DebugSanitizeHW": {
      // Same as 'Debug'
      "sanitize": [
         "hwaddress",
         "undefined",
         "leak"
      ]
   },
   "DebugSanitizeHWAddress": {
      // Same as 'Debug'
      "sanitize": "hwaddress"
   },
   "ReleaseSanitizeUndefined": {
      // Same as 'Release'
      "sanitize": "undefined"
   }
}
```

\\

## [Example: Custom Release]

If in a project, one wants to use the default Debug & Profile configuration, but use a custom Release configuration with an `optimizationLevel` of `3`, they would define the following:

```json
"defaultConfigurations": [
   "Debug",
   "Profile"
],
"configurations": {
   "Release": {
      "optimizationLevel": "3",
      "debugSymbols": false,
      "interproceduralOptimization": false,
      "enableProfiling": false,
      "sanitize": false
   }
}
```
