# [${meta.title}]

Some of Chalet's commands have largely been mentioned in passing up to this point, since they require a `chalet.json` to run. Now it's time to dive deeper into what they do, and what kind of options are available, so it'll be assumed that a working `chalet.json` exists up to this point.

## [Overview]

Chalet uses sub-commands (like `build` & `run`) along with arguments specific to their context. To see which arguments a sub-command allows, one can use `--help` or `-h`. `chalet --help` will provide the list of sub-commands themselves while `chalet (sub-command) --help` will show the options for that sub-command.


## [Build Commands]

Build commands all have the same options

```bash
chalet buildrun 
chalet run 
chalet build 
chalet rebuild  
chalet clean 
chalet bundle
```
