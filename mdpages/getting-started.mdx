# [Getting Started]

---

At the moment, Chalet must be installed manually in non-Windows operating systems, but in the future will be available through Homebrew/package managers. Before working with Chalet, the application should be accessible from PATH.

---
## [Compiler / Prerequisites]

Before building, you should have a C/C++ compiler chosen for your platform, and available in PATH.

<!-- accordion:start -->

<!-- tabs:start -->
|Windows|
Install one of the following:
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Recommended)
* [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)
* [MinGW via MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)

|MacOS|
Install one of the following:
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (Recommended)
* [Command Line Tools for Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=%22command%20line%20tools%22)

If using Xcode:
* Ensure Xcode.app is placed in Applications
* Run the following from Terminal:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

If using Command Line Tools:
* Run the installer from the dmg image & restart Terminal if necessary
* Run the following:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

In both, run `which clang` and ensure you see `/usr/bin/clang`

|Linux|
It's recommended to start with the compiler that comes with your distribution. Chalet will detect GCC by default, but this can be configured later.

Additional Tools Recommended:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Used in Chalet for fetching external dependencies
* [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) - By design, it's quicker than Make
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) - Used to integrate external code into Chalet projects

## [Creating a Project]

Once Chalet is installed, either run:

```bash
chalet init my-project
cd my-project
```

or

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
chalet init
```

You'll be shown a wizard that will guide you the rest of the way, creating a simple "Hello World" project, a chalet.json, and optionally a git repository.
