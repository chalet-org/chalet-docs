# [Getting Started]

---

At the moment, Chalet must be installed manually in non-Windows operating systems, but in the future will be available through Homebrew/package managers. Before working with Chalet, the application should be accessible from PATH.

\\

## [Machine Setup]

<!-- accordion:start Adding a C/C++ Compiler -->

Before building, you should have a C/C++ compiler chosen for your platform, and available in PATH.

<!-- tabs:start -->
|Windows|
**Install one of the following:**
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Recommended)
* [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)
* [MinGW-w64 via MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
* A standalone MinGW build (MinGW-w64, TDM-GCC, etc.) 

\

**If using Visual Studio:**
* In the VS Installer, Install C++ related components, but most importantly, the x64/x86 build tools (and optionally ARM, ARM64).
* Also install the bundled CMake tools if you wish
* Chalet uses [vswhere](https://github.com/microsoft/vswhere) to figure out the rest of the Visual Studio environment, so no further steps are necessary

\

**If using LLVM:**
* Install LLVM and either add to Path directly in Windows Environment Variables or create a .env file in your project to modify Path
* Use the following command in your project before building:

```bash
chalet configure --toolchain llvm
```

> Note: LLVM on Windows uses the Visual Studio ABI `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` by default (and requires a Visual Studio installation anyway)

\

**If using MinGW-w64 (GCC) via MSYS2:**
* Install MSYS2 - This defaults to the path `C:\msys64`
* Update the package database with `pacman -Syu` (Note: some packages may be less stable though)
* Add MinGW (32 & 64 bit versions respectively) via:

```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-i686-toolchain
```

* Check for GCC with `gcc --version`
* Add `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` to Path directly in Windows Environment Variables (not recommended) or create a .env file in your project to modify Path

> Note: If both 32 and 64 version are installed, Chalet only needs one of the bin folders in path. It will reinterpret the path based on the requested architecture of the build.

> Note: One can also install clang from MSYS2, but support for it in Chalet is still experimental...

\

**If using a standalone MinGW build:**
* Install/extract it where you please. It is recommended to use sub-folders for 32-bit and 64-bit versions if compiling for both, and to use the convention `mingw32` and `mingw64` for those subfolder names
* Add `(folder)\mingw64\bin` to Path directly in Windows Environment Variables (not recommended) or create a .env file in your project to modify Path

> Note: If both 32 and 64 version are installed, Chalet only needs one of the bin folders in path. It will reinterpret the path based on the requested architecture of the build.

|MacOS|
**Install one of the following:**
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (Recommended)
* [Command Line Tools for Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=%22command%20line%20tools%22)

\

**If using Xcode:**
* Ensure Xcode.app is placed in Applications
* Run the following from Terminal:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

\

**If using Command Line Tools:**
* Run the installer from the dmg image & restart Terminal if necessary
* Run the following:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

In both, running `which clang` should show `/usr/bin/clang` (although it actually resolves to the xcode-select path)

|Linux|
It's recommended to start with the compiler that comes with your distribution. Chalet will detect GCC by default, but this can be configured later.

<!-- accordion:start Additional Software -->

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Used in Chalet for fetching & managing external dependencies
* [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) - By design, it's quicker than Make
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) - Used to integrate external code into Chalet projects

<!-- accordion:end -->

\\

## [Creating a Project]

Once Chalet is installed and a compiler is available, run either:

```bash
chalet init my-project
cd my-project
```

or

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
chalet init
```

You'll be shown a wizard that will guide you the rest of the way, creating a simple "Hello World" project, a chalet.json, and optionally a git repository. In the last step, you'll be asked to configure the project.
