At the moment, Chalet must be installed manually in non-Windows operating systems, but in the future will be available through Homebrew/package managers. Before working with Chalet, the application should be accessible from PATH.

* [Releases](https://github.com/chalet-org/chalet-dev/releases)

\\

## [Machine Setup]

<!-- accordion:start Adding a C/C++ Compiler -->

Before building, you should have a C/C++ compiler chosen for your platform, and make it available from PATH.

<!-- tabs:start -->
|Windows|
**Install one of the following:**
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Recommended)
* [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)
* [MinGW-w64 via MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
* A standalone MinGW build (TDM-GCC, MinGW-w64 from Sourceforge, etc.) 

\

**If using Visual Studio:**
* In the VS Installer, Install C++ related components, but most importantly, the x64/x86 build tools (and optionally ARM, ARM64).
* Also install the bundled CMake tools if you wish
* Use one of the following commands in your project before building:

```bash
# To target the latest stable/preview installation:
chalet configure --toolchain vs-stable
chalet configure --toolchain vs-preview 

# To target specific VS installations (>= 2017 until earlier ones can be tested):
chalet configure --toolchain vs-2022
chalet configure --toolchain vs-2019
chalet configure --toolchain vs-2017
```

Otherwise, chalet implicitly uses the `vs-stable` toolchain preset. stable/preview can target future VS versions before Chalet officially supports them.

> Note: Chalet uses [vswhere](https://github.com/microsoft/vswhere) to get the rest of the Visual Studio environment, so no Path environment variable changes are needed

\

**If using LLVM:**
* Install LLVM and either add to Path directly in Windows Environment Variables or create a .env file in your project to modify Path
* Use the following command in your project before building:

```bash
chalet configure --toolchain llvm
```

* Or to use LLVM by default with Chalet:
```bash
chalet set --global options.toolchain llvm
```

> Note: LLVM on Windows uses the Visual Studio ABI `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` by default (and requires a Visual Studio installation anyway)

\

**If using MinGW-w64 (GCC) via MSYS2:**
* Install MSYS2 - This defaults to the path `C:\msys64`
* Update the package database with `pacman -Syu` (Note: some packages may be less stable though)
* Add MinGW (32 & 64 bit versions respectively) via:

```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-i686-toolchain
```

* Check for GCC with `gcc --version`
* Add `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` to Path directly in Windows Environment Variables (not recommended) or create a .env file in your project to modify Path
* Use one of the following commands in your project before building:

```bash
# To use the same architecture as the host machine:
chalet configure --toolchain gcc

# To explicity use the 64 or 32-bit toolchains:
chalet configure --toolchain x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
chalet configure --toolchain i686-w64-mingw32-gcc
```

* To use GCC by default with Chalet:
```bash
chalet set --global options.toolchain gcc
chalet set --global options.toolchain x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
chalet set --global options.toolchain i686-w64-mingw32-gcc
```

> Note: If both 32 and 64 version are installed, Chalet only needs one of the bin folders in path. It will reinterpret the path based on the requested architecture of the build.

> Note: One can also install clang from MSYS2, but support for it in Chalet is still experimental...

\

**If using a standalone MinGW build:**
* Install/extract it where you please. It is recommended to use sub-folders for 32-bit and 64-bit versions if compiling for both, and to use the convention `mingw32` and `mingw64` for those subfolder names
* Add `(folder)\mingw64\bin` to Path directly in Windows Environment Variables (not recommended) or create a .env file in your project to modify Path
* If you know the architecture triple used in the toolchain, you can configure chalet using that + '-gcc', or simply use `gcc`
```bash
chalet configure --toolchain gcc
```

> Note: If both 32 and 64 version are installed, Chalet only needs one of the bin folders in path. It will reinterpret the path based on the requested architecture of the build.

|MacOS|
**Install one of the following:**
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (Recommended)
* [Command Line Tools for Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=%22command%20line%20tools%22)

\

**If using Xcode:**
* Ensure Xcode.app is placed in Applications
* Run the following from Terminal:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
```

\

**If using Command Line Tools:**
* Run the installer from the dmg image & restart Terminal if necessary
* Run the following:

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
```

In both, running `which clang` should show `/usr/bin/clang`, although it actually resolves to the xcode-select path.

Configure Chalet with:
```bash
chalet configure --toolchain apple-llvm
```

\

> Note: LLVM and GCC can also be used on Mac (both can be grabbed from Homebrew), but they are not recommended for any serious projects.

|Linux|
**Install one of the following**
* Your distribution's compiler (typically GCC)
* Any GCC cross-compiler (ie. arm-linux-gnueabihf)
* [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)

Every Linux build is going to be a little different, so this is more like a set of guidelines.

You should have at least the following packages from your package manager:
```
base-devel git cmake ninja gdb
```

**If using GCC:**
* Chalet will detect GCC by default, so nothing further should be necessary. Use the 'gcc' toolchain preset to explicitly request it, or the name of toolchain's target triple + '-gcc'

```bash
# To use the same architecture as the host machine:
chalet configure --toolchain gcc

# To explicity use a specific toolchain or cross-compiler:
chalet configure --toolchain x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc
chalet configure --toolchain i686-linux-gnu-gcc
chalet configure --toolchain arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc
```

**If using LLVM:**
* Use the following command in your project before building:
```bash
chalet configure --toolchain llvm
```

* Or to use LLVM by default with Chalet:
```bash
chalet set --global options.toolchain llvm
```

<!-- accordion:start Additional Software -->

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Used in Chalet for fetching & managing external dependencies
* [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) - Make alternative, that is quicker by design due to how it manages dependencies
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) - Used to integrate external code into Chalet projects

<!-- accordion:end -->

<!-- accordion:start Tab Completion for Bash -->

Each Chalet release should come with a `chalet-completion.sh` file. To use this on your machine, simply source the file from `~/.bash_profile` and restart your terminal instance. You can also run the source command from your terminal beforehand in order to test the tab completion.

```bash
source "(CHALET_PATH)/chalet-completion.sh"
```

<!-- accordion:end -->

\\

## [Creating a Project]

Once Chalet is installed and a compiler is available, run either:

```bash
chalet init my-project
cd my-project
```

or

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
chalet init
```

You'll be shown a wizard that will guide you the rest of the way, creating a simple "Hello World" project, a chalet.json, and optionally a git repository. In the last step, you'll be asked to configure the project.

Additionally, you can initialize a Chalet+CMake project with the following command:

```bash
chalet init --template cmake
```

\\

## [Settings Overview]

During the build, Chalet uses a generated settings file, `.chaletrc`, to control machine-specific paths and settings. The `configure` command is a way to  configure the build and download dependencies without running the build yet. It takes the same cli options as the main set of build commands, but only changes the settings file. This way, you can change settings for each build on the fly without having to configure each time. Typically you would use it to change the toolchain, architecture, paths of ancillary tools, and on mac: apple sdk paths. If a `.chaletrc` file exists in the user/home directory and has its own paths and toolchains defined, they will be copied over into the project's `.chaletrc`.

> Note: The output color scheme can also be controlled via `.chaletrc` from either the local or global settings, but it does not get automatically copied from the global settings like the other properties.

\

**Toolchains**

The toolchain refers to either a preset (`llvm` `apple-llvm` `gcc` `vs-stable` `vs-preview`) or a custom name that resolves to a toolchain structure in the project settings file. A preset will attempt to detect the executables for the requested toolchain (if they're found in Path) and add them to the settings file. 

The toolchain is specified with either `--toolchain (name)` or `-t (name)`
The architecture is specified with either `--arch (name)` or `-a (name)`.  Architectures will be described in more detail later, but in general, it does not need to be specified if you are compiling for your host architecture. `-a auto` explicity sets the output architecture to the host machine's.

<!-- tabs:start -->
|MSVC|

```bash
chalet configure -t vs-stable -a x64 
chalet configure -t vs-preview -a x64
chalet configure -t vs-2022 -a arm64
chalet configure -t vs-2019 -a x64
chalet configure -t vs-2017 -a x86 
```

These attempt to find the target architecture and create the toolchain: '(arch)-pc-windows-msvc(version)' where 'version' is the detected VS version (or Preview version) - 16, 17, etc.

```bash
chalet configure -t vs-stable -a auto
```

This uses the latest non-preview version of MSVC, attempts to detect it, and uses the machine's host architecture.

|LLVM|

```bash
chalet configure -t llvm -a x86_64
chalet configure -t apple-llvm -a x86_64 
chalet configure -t apple-llvm -a arm64 
chalet configure -t apple-llvm -a universal 
```

These create the toolchain 'llvm' or 'apple-llvm' since Clang handles the architecture itself. 

```bash
chalet configure -t llvm -a auto
```

This detects LLVM from path and uses the machine's host architecture.

|GCC|

GCC works a little differently from the others. In situations where there is no cross compiler installed, the following will suffice:

```bash
chalet configure -t gcc -a auto
```

For cross compilers, since there is a 1:1 relationship between the version of GCC and the architecture it was built for: Chalet can detect the correct versions of GCC using the literal filename to the "gcc" you want. For example:

```bash
chalet configure -t x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc
chalet configure -t x86_64-x64-mingw32-gcc
chalet configure -t gcc-11 
```

|Intel|

Intel support is experimental, but this is the way to get started:

**Intel LLVM w/ a Visual Studio 2019 Environment (Windows):**
```bash
chalet configure -t intel-llvm-vs-2019
```

**Intel Classic (MacOS):**

```bash
chalet configure -t intel-classic -a auto build
```


<!-- tabs:end -->

> Note: In all cases, you can edit the generated toolchain name, and refine paths to executables later, and save them for use globally.

\

**Build Configurations**

There are a handful of default build configurations, but by far, the most common are `Release` and `Debug`. If new to C++, `Debug` implies there are no optimizations done, and the build will be used alongside a debugger, while `Release` performs optimizations (within reason) for a released application.

During the configure step the `Release` build configuration will be chosen and configured in settings. If it's a new project, `Debug` will be more desireable. To select the configuration you want to use for the command, simply add `--configuration (name)` or `-c (name)`. For example:

```bash
chalet configure -c Debug -t llvm -a auto
```

> Note: Build configurations can be customized by defining a `configurations` structure in `chalet.json` with either a list of new configuration objects, or `defaultConfigurations`, a string list that limits the default ones (for example, to just `Release` and `Debug`)

\\

## [The First Build]

Create that first build with:

```bash
chalet buildrun
```

This will build the application, and run it immediately.

If the output directory is `build`, this will generate a build of the project into the folder `build/(id)_(configuration)` where `id` is a either the target triple or the toolchain name. The subfolder can also be customized to just the configuration if that makes for an easier workflow.

The following commands rely on the build configuration in settings:

```bash
chalet buildrun 
chalet run 
chalet build 
chalet rebuild  
chalet clean 
```

The `buildrun` & `run` commands can also take the target you want to run afterwards (including its arguments). Therefore, if multiple executables are built, and one wants to run a target called "my-tests", one can use any of the following.

No arguments:
```bash
chalet buildrun my-tests
```

Remaining arguments after the executable target will be passed to the executable:
```bash
chalet buildrun my-tests -w NoTests -s
```

A single string argument will be parsed and passed to the executable as separate arguments:
```bash
chalet run my-tests '-w NoTests -s'
```
