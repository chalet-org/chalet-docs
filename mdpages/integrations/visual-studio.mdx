There are a few different ways to integrated Chalet with [Visual Studio](//visualstudio.microsoft.com/). The obvious shortcoming of building with MSVC at the command-line is how to then open the project inside of Visual Studio. Would it be opened as a Chalet project? Can it be converted to a VS project? As of Chalet v0.5.0, the following can be done:

\\

## [Export a Solution]
 
To generate a solution file (`.sln`) and `.vcxproj` files for each build target, there's two options: 

You can run the `export` command to simply generate them: 

```bash
chalet export -t vs-2022 vssolution
```

This adds the solution `build/.vssolution/project.sln` and the `.vcxproj` files to `build/.vssolution/vcxproj/(name).vcxproj`. It will include all of the current build configurations setup by the project. However, this doesn't take into account any current builds that have run, so it is recommended to clean your build folder if any builds were run prior to running this command.

Any edits done in the [build file](/docs/the-build-file) will require the .sln to be re-exported.

Once the `.sln` file has been opened inside Visual Studio, you should see all of the build configurations that were set at the time of export:

Before starting the build (or the debugger), set the startup project to the executable you want to run (if applicable).

If using the "Local Windows Debugger', or "Build Solution", you should see the expected build output in the Output window.

## [Using MSBuild]

The better method is to simply use the `msbuild` strategy (available only in the Windows version of Chalet). For example:

```bash
chalet build -t vs-2022 -a auto -b msbuild 
```

This will generate the same project files as the export method above, and build them via [MSBuild](//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild?view=vs-2022), using the same build cache that Visual Studio uses, so you use the project within VS and the command line interchangeably.

\\

## [JSON Project Configuration]

In Visual Studio 2017 and higher, "open folder" is supported, but with a catch - in order to run build commands from another build system, you would need to create a few files at the root of the folder opened in VS:

| **CppProperties.json** | intellisense configuration |
| **tasks.vs.json**      | build tasks |
| **launch.vs.json**     | debugger configuration |

Detailed information can be found [here](//docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/open-folder-projects-cpp?view=msvc-170).

While you could certainly create these and manage them yourself, it would be a lot nicer to generate them. The following command can be run:

```bash
chalet export -t vs-2022 vsjson
```

The files are generated to `build/.vs` as not clash with any existing files that may be checked-in. If `(workspace)/.vs` doesn't exist, it will get copied there.

Open the root path in Visual Studio, and you should see a list of available build configurations:

![Visual Studio JSON with build configurations](/images/visualstudio/vs-shot4.png)

The executable projects should be selectable in the dropdown below. It will only show the configurations that have been built.

To build your project, the standard `Build`, `Rebuild` and `Clean` should work, with the additional "Run Chalet: ..." commands available in the Folder View's context menu:

This attempts to provide a general configuration for the entire project. You'll most likely want to generate a VS Solution anyway for precise intellisense and to take full advantage of all that VS has to offer, but this is an option if you want to build using Chalet inside of Visual Studio.

> Note: If your project has more than one executable, the path to the target to be launched in the debugger will need to edited manually from `launch.vs.json`.

## [With Modules]

Module projects are completely supported in the above methods. Project files are generated in such a way that any additional module files can be added to the project without additional per-file configuration in VS. However, just like in Chalet itself, a modules target treats all included source files as modules, so just don't mix and match them with regular source files in the same target. Make a static library target and link it to the module target.
