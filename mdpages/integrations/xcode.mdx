[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) is Apple's IDE, designed to develop software for its platforms. You can get it from the [Apple Developer downloads](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/) page or through the app store. Generating an Xcode project from Chalet is pretty straightforward.

\\

## [Export a project]

The following will generate an [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) project (.xcodeproj) into `build/.xcode`. It's designed to open and build to the same directories that Chalet normally uses, although this is still somewhat a work in-progress since Xcode generates some extra directories.

```bash
chalet export -t apple-llvm xcode
```

To open it, this requires an Xcode install. You cannot use Command Line Tools with this. Any edits done in the `chalet.json` file will require it to be re-exported.

Once in Xcode, each build target will be selectable in the [project's toolbar](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/customizing-the-build-schemes-for-a-project).

To change the build configuration, click on "Edit Scheme..." above, and under the "Run" tab on the left, you'll find the Build Configuration dropdown.

More information can be found here: [Customizing the build schemes for a project](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/customizing-the-build-schemes-for-a-project)

If needed, the build output can be viewed in the report navigator. Every target type except source targets are considered scripts in Xcode. Because of this, you could be building 100 source files from a CMake target, but Xcode would tally it as "1" object in the total build.

## [Using Xcodebuild]

Like with Visual Studio, Xcode has been integrated with Chalet as a build strategy, so you can simultaneously export and build the Xcode project inside of Chalet using `xcodebuild`. The command for this is the following:

```bash
chalet build -t apple-llvm -b xcodebuild
```

\\

## [App Bundles]

If you already have an app bundle setup as a [distribution target](/docs/describing-the-distribution?id=mac-os-bundles), it will be generated with the rest of the Xcode project. If using the `xcodebuild` strategy, it will be skipped in `chalet build`, but not in `chalet bundle` (same behavior as before). If you open the project in Xcode, you can build the app bundle inside the editor.
