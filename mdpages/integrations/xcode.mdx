Support was just added in [Version 0.6.4](/download/v0.6.4). Documentation is still a work in progress.

\\

## [Overview]

The following will generate an [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) project (.xcodeproj) into `build/.xcode`. It's designed to open and build to the same directories that Chalet normally uses, although this is still somewhat a work in-progress since Xcode generates some extra directories.

```bash
chalet export -t apple-llvm  xcode
```

\\

## [Using Xcodebuild]

Like with Visual Studio, Xcode has been integrated with Chalet as a build strategy, so you can simultaneously export and build the Xcode project inside of Chalet using `xcodebuild`. The command for this is as follows.

```bash
chalet build -t apple-llvm -b xcodebuild
```

To open it, this requies an Xcode install. You cannot use Command Line Tools with this.

Once in Xcode, each build target will be selectable in the [top bar](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-a-new-target-in-your-project). Build configurations can only be changed in the [Build Scheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/customizing-the-build-schemes-for-a-project) as far as I know.

## [App Bundles]

If you already have an app bundle setup as a [distribution target](/docs/describing-the-distribution?id=mac-os-bundles), it will be generated with the rest of the Xcode project. If using the xcodebuild strategy, it will be skipped in `chalet build`, but not in `chalet bundle` (same behavior as before). If you open the project in Xcode, you can build the app bundle inside the editor.
