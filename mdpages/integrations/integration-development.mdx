One of the main design goals of Chalet is to make it interoperable and integratable with IDEs and code editors. There are some handy commands to get information that would otherwise not available outside of Chalet.

\\

## [Overview]

In order to receive information about a project, Chalet can be queried to either get a tab-separated list of something or some JSON back, depending on the query. This is accomplished with the aptly named `query` subcommand. 

```bash
chalet query <type> [ARG...]
```

This command takes in a string of something to query for, and maybe an argument. For example, to retrieve the JSON schema for both build and settings files, the following commands would be used:

```bash
chalet query schema-chalet-json
chalet query schema-settings-json
```

At the moment, this command just gets the schemas for the current version of Chalet. From there, they can be used by editors if JSON schema is supported.

## [Reading State]

State can be thought of in this way: Any time there's a change in either the build file, or the settings file, the state should be read back to the editor. Ultimately, how this is done is up to the implementer, but the state queries are designed to retrieve those changes minimally, along with anything that the installed version of Chalet supports. 

In the case of build file state changes, it could mean the name of a build target has changed, or a build configuration was added, removed, or renamed. Here's an example result from a project called `foo`:

```json
{
   "configurations": [
      "Release",
      "Debug"
   ],
   "targets": [
      "foo"
   ],
   "runTargets": [
      "foo"
   ],
   "defaultRunTarget": "foo"
}
```

If `defaultConfigrations` in the root of the build file was limited to just `Debug` and `Release`, `configurations` would return them. This is the same list returned from `chalet query configurations`, which returns a tab-separated list of the same thing.

`runTargets` are a list of any executable targets in the workspace, while `defaultRunTarget` is the first executable source target.

Settings state changes contain a bit more details:

```json
{
	"allToolchains": [
		"apple-llvm",
		"x86_64-apple-darwin-gnu",
		"llvm",
		"gcc",
		"intel-classic"
	],
	"toolchainPresets": [
		"apple-llvm",
		"llvm",
		"gcc",
		"intel-classic"
	],
	"userToolchains": [
		"apple-llvm",
		"x86_64-apple-darwin-gnu"
	],
	"architecture": "auto",
	"configuration": "Release",
	"architectures": [
		"auto",
		"universal",
		"x86_64",
		"arm64"
	],
	"toolchain": "apple-llvm"
}
```

Since toolchains can be a preset, or a user-defined toolchain, they are classified into two different arrays (`toolchainPresets` and `userToolchains`) along with `allToolchains` for convenience. The architectures are contextual to the current toolchain being used, so the ones in the example above only apply to `apple-llvm`.

To get a tab-separated list of the same architectures, the command would be `chalet query architectures apple-llvm`.
