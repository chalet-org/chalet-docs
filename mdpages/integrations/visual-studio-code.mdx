[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a cross-platform code editor with support for a vast array of extensions. For convenience, there's an official Chalet extension designed to make working with it inside of VS Code fast and easy.

## [Official Extension]

[Get it from the Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chalet-org.vscode-chalet)

The main problem the extension seeks to solve is that in order to create numerous builds and build configurations, VS Code requires the creation of several tasks (each with a single command line). This would get tedious to manage, so the extension provides various buttons to make it easier to interact with Chalet's actions, build configurations, toolchains, and architectures. 

The extension itself requires Chalet to be installed and visible from PATH. It does not do this for you, so before installing the extension, make sure Chalet is available from the command line.

Since the extension gets everything it needs from Chalet itself, you can theoretically update Chalet in the future without affecting the extension.
