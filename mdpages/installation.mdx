# [Installation]

At the moment, Chalet must be installed manually in non-Windows operating systems, but in the future will be available through Homebrew/package managers. Before working with Chalet, the application should be accessible from PATH. On Windows, this is done either through setting environment variables (or selecting the installer option), while on other operating systems, this is done through your shell.
