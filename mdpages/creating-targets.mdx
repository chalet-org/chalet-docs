The philosophy behind Chalet projects is quite simple: Abstract away only what needs to be abstracted, and unify as much of the build as possible.

\\

## [At A Glance]

By far the most important part of a Chalet project is its targets. Targets are defined in sequential order, and describe individual source compilation targets, CMake projects, other Chalet project, or scripts.

* [Source Target](/schema/latest/source-target) - A folder, set of folders, or files with compilation options
* [Source Target](/schema/latest/chalet-target) - A subfolder that contains a separate chalet.json
* [CMake Target](/schema/latest/cmake-target) - A subfolder that contains a CMakeLists.txt
* [Script Target](/schema/latest/cmake-target) - A path to an individual script, of the following types: `.sh` `.bat` `.ps1` `.py` `.rb` `.pl` and `.lua`. Portable shebangs — `#!/usr/bin/env (executable)` — are also supported with any extension.

```json
"targets": {
   "first": {
      "location": "src/first"
   },
   "second": {
      "type": "CMake",
      "location": "vendor/second"
   },
   "third": {
      "type": "Chalet",
      "location": "vendor/third"
   },
   "post-build": {
      "script": "scripts/post-build.py"
   }
}
```

With this approach, external dependencies can be pulled in from other sources like git, placed wherever we need them, and built as closely as possible to the rest of the project without necessarily having to write extra scripts. Chalet can orchestrate some of that work for you, in addition to just building your own source code. 

\\

## [Abstract Targets]

Abstracts are source targets that do not build by themselves, and instead get extended in source targets. For example, if there are two different source targets that both require the same compilation options, one can write them out twice, but that wouldn't be very programmatic. The solution for this is to create an abstract and extend it in each source target. They can be declared in one of two ways.

First, simply with a root `abstracts` object:

```json
"abstracts": {
   "all": {
      ...
   },
   "minimal": {
      ...
   }
}
```

Second, with a colon separating `abstracts` and the name of the abstract target:

```json
// Possibly more desireable in small projects
"abstracts:all": {
   ...
},
"abstracts:minimal": {
   ...
}
```

Which one you decide to use doesn't matter, but it's recommended to pick one style over the other rather than mix them.

An example of how abstracts could be used is if stricter warnings are desired on one target, while they need to be more relaxed on another:

```json
"abstracts": {
   "strict": {
      ...
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "warnings": "strict"
      }
   },
   "minimal": {
      ...
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "warnings": "minimal"
      }
   }
},
"targets": {
   "first-target": {
      "extends": "strict",
      ...
   },
   "second-target": {
      "extends": "strict",
      ...
   },
   "third-target": {
      "extends": "minimal",
      ...
   }
}
```

Another common situation is where one target needs to be compiled as C, while the rest as C++, or perhaps.

`all` is a special abstract target that gets implicitly extended in all source targets. Therefore, there's no need to define `"extends": "all"` since it would be equivalent to not defining it.

```json
"abstracts:all": {
   ...
},
"targets": {
   "my-project": {
      ...
      // "extends": "all"
   }
}
```

\\

Another way of writing the strict/minimal example, utilizing `all` would be:

```json
"abstracts:all": {
   "settings:Cxx": {
      "warnings": "strict"
   }
},
"targets": {
   "first-target": {
      ...
   },
   "second-target": {
      ...
   },
   "third-target": {
      ...
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "warnings": "minimal"
      }
   }
}
```

`"warnings": "minimal"` would simply override `"warnings": "strict"` in this case.

> Note: A single source target can extend a single abstract target, but an abstract target can not extend another abstract target.

\\

## [Source Targets]

With abstracts out of the way, we can start thinking about how to structure our source targets. As you would expect with any C++ build system, we can add include directories, macro definitions, compiler warnings, define precompiled headers, and a handful of other goodies to ensure our project remains as compiler-independent and cross-platform as possible. 

```json
"targets": {
   "my-project": {
      "kind": "executable",
      "language": "C++",
      "location": "src",
      "runProject": true,
      "settings:Cxx": {
         "pch": "src/PCH.hpp",
         "cppStandard": "c++20",
         "warnings": "strict",
         "threads": "auto",
         "rtti": false,
         "exceptions": true,
         "staticLinking": false,
         "defines": [
            "LIB_FOO"
         ],
         "defines:debug": [
            "_DEBUG"
         ],
         "includeDirs": [
            "${externalDir}/foo/include",
            "${externalDir}/bar/include"
         ],
         "libDirs": [
            "${externalDir}/foo/lib"
         ],
         "links": [
            "foo"
         ],
         "links.windows": [
            "bar"
         ]
      }
   }
}
```

Some of these properties will be covered here, as well as ways to express them, while others will be explained are detailed in the schema documentation, [here](http://localhost:3000/schema-dev/main/source-target).

The main required properties for source targets are `language`, `kind`, `settings` and `location` / `files`.

* Languages: `C++` `C` 
* Kinds: `executable` `sharedLibrary` `staticLibrary`

\\

## [Property Conditions]

Most properties support conditions that describe whether to include or exclude them from the build. These are simply suffixes that describe the build configuration or platform:

* `debug` / `!debug` if the build configuration uses debug symbols (Debug/RelWithDebInfo/Profile) or doesn't use them.
* `(platform)` / `!(platform)` where platform is or isn't `macos` `linux` & `windows`

Most properties support both, but some support one and not the other where appropriate. `debug` can be combined with a single platform, separated by a period, in either order:

```
.debug.(platform)
.(platform).debug
```

If a property with conditions are defined along with a property without them (for example: `links`, `links.debug.windows` & `links.windows`), the order may need to be considered. In this example, `links` will be read first, `links.windows` second, followed by `links.debug.windows`.

\

**Excluding Targets**

Targets can be excluded with the `condition` property, and works the exact same way as property conditions:

```json
"first-target": {
   "condition": "debug.!windows"
}
"second-target": {
   "condition": "linux"
}
```

\\

## [Adding Source Files]

There are two ways to handle source files: Define the location(s) that will search directories recursively, or define each file explicitly. In both scenarios, the following file extensions are supported:
* C: `c` 
* C++: `cpp` `cc` `cxx` `c++` / `CPP` `CC` `CXX` `C++` `C`
* Windows Resource: `rc` / `RC`
* Objective-C: `m` / `M`
* Objective-C++: `mm`

> Note: Lowercase extensions are recommended

\

**By Location**

Locations are a simple way to express where sources are found. The first way is as a string to a folder path:

```json
"location": "src"
```

This would describe a root folder called "src" that contains files all source files with supported extensions. 

The `location` property can also be expressed an array:

```json
"location": [
   "src/foo",
   "src/bar"
]
```

As one would expect, this would include any folders that are specified.

One can also express `location` as an object, with `include` (string or array) and `exclude` (string or array).

```json
"location": {
   "include": [
      "src",
      "test"
   ],
   "exclude": "src/Main.cpp"
}
```

Glob patterns are supported:

```json
"location": {
   "include": "src/**",
   "exclude": "src/Foo/**/*.cpp"
}
```

Finally, one can also include/exclude based on platform using the property conditions explained earlier:

```json
"location": {
   "include": "src",
   "exclude.!macos": [
      "src/MacOS"
   ],
   "exclude.!windows": [
      "src/Windows"
   ],
   "exclude.!linux": [
      "src/Linux"
   ]
}
```

> Note: `include` will only resolve to folders, while `exclude` can resolve both files and folders.

\

**By Files**

Defining files is very easy. Instead of using `location`, simply define a `files` array and list each file.

```json
"files": [
   "src/main.cpp",
   "src/foo.cpp",
   "src/bar.cpp"
]
```

Glob patterns are supported:

```json
"files": [
   "src/**/*.cpp",
   "src/**/*.rc"
]
```

Property conditions are also supported:

```json
"files": [
   "src/main.cpp"
]
"files.windows": [
   "src/Windows/foo.cpp"
]
"files.macos": [
   "src/MacOS/bar.cpp"
]
```
