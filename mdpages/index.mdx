!# Chalet

A modern cross-platform project format and build system for C/C++ with a focus on readability and interoperability.

---
#### [What does it do?]

Chalet is a command-line application that reads in a JSON project file (ie. chalet.json), finds a usable compiler in PATH, and builds your C/C++ projects. Behind the scenes, Chalet generates either a [Make](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) or [Ninja](//ninja-build.org/) build file, does some caching, builds, and optionally runs your executable. Chalet project files are designed to be easy to understand, focusing on GNU-like language, and translating that down to the compiler. Because the projects are JSON, they can be easily integrated with IDEs, requiring only a JSON parser, available in practically every language.

In addition to building your projects during the development process, Chalet has numerous other features designed to make working with C/C++ as smooth as possible:

* Bundle your applications & libraries for distribution
* Fetch & manage external git repositories based on commits, tags or branches
* Profiling tool integrations - Instruments on macOS, gprof in Linux/MinGW
* Support for cross-compiling
* CI support (tested with Github Actions)
* Include other Chalet projects as build steps
* Include [CMake](//cmake.org/) projects as build steps
* Run scripts as build steps (so far: bash, powershell (Win / Core), Batch (Win), python, ruby, lua, perl)
* Define abstract build steps in order to tune the build
* A wizard for generating new projects: `chalet init`
* CLI Commands for manipulating the settings & build file (ie. from the CI)
* MSVC Support on Windows (VS 2019 & 2022 Previews currently)
* Objective-C/C++ support on macOS
* Universal binary support on macOS (Intel & M1)
* A Visual Studio Code extension

#### [Why Chalet?]

It's a beautifully constructed home. It also starts with 'C'.

---
#### [Future Plans]

* Support for more compilers: Intel, CUDA, Emscripten to name a few
* iOS Support, which ultimately means working with the Swift compiler or XCode in some way. There's partial support already
* Android support
* A "native" build strategy to optionally try instead of Make/Ninja
* Generate other project file types
* Optional YAML project files possibly?
* Support for more languages one day

#### [Examples]

* [A basic shared library](//github.com/chalet-org/chalet-example-sharedlib)
* [An SFML / OpenGL project (integrates with CMake)](//github.com/chalet-org/chalet-example-sfml)
* [Interacting with another language (Mono C#)](//github.com/chalet-org/chalet-example-mono)
* [Call other Chalet projects (builds all of the above)](//github.com/chalet-org/chalet-examples)
