Chalet is a command-line application that reads from a JSON project file (chalet.json), and compiles your C/C++ projects. Behind the scenes, Chalet generates either a [Ninja](//ninja-build.org/) or [Make](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) build file and performs some caching. Chalet project files focus on intuitive language designed to be easy to understand, while at the same time providing lots of control. Because the projects are JSON, they can be easily integrated with IDEs.

In addition, Chalet has numerous features designed to make working with C/C++ as smooth as possible:

* Fetch & manage external git repositories based on commits, tags or branches
* Include [CMake](//cmake.org/) projects or other Chalet projects as build steps
* A wizard for initializing new projects
* Some basic distribution/bundling features
* Run scripts & processes as build steps
* Tab completion script for Bash
* A Visual Studio Code extension
