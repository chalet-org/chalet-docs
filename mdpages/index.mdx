Chalet is a command-line application that reads from a JSON or YAML project file (chalet.json or chalet.yaml), and compiles your C/C++ projects. Chalet project files focus on intuitive language designed to be easy to understand, while at the same time providing lots of control.

---

In addition, Chalet has numerous features designed to make working with C/C++ as smooth as possible:

* Fetch & manage external git repositories based on commits, tags or branches
* Include [CMake](//cmake.org/), [Meson](//mesonbuild.com/) or other Chalet projects as build steps
* A wizard for initializing new projects
* Some basic distribution/bundling features
* Run scripts & processes as build steps
* Tab completion script for zsh/bash/sh/fish
* A Visual Studio Code extension
